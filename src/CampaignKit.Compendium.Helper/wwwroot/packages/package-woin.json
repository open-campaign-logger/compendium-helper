          "Markdown": "# Abjuration Enhancements\r\n\r\nAbsure [self], [creature], [element], or [virtue]\r\n\r\nAbjuration spells can provide numerous types of protection and defenses. Most abjuration spells defend individual creatures or objects, but you can create a spell that limits the movements of creatures into or out of an area, enhance Defense, grant damage resistance, or restrict the movements of certain creatures.\r\n\r\nAbjuration also includes the suppression or dispelling of magical effects.\r\n\r\nAn abjure cantrip can grant 1 point of SOAK against a specific damage type for up to one round. This is enough to provide basic environmental protection against nonextreme conditions.\r\n\r\n## Antimagic\r\n\r\nBreaching. Cost 2 MP per 1d6. This gives the target a +1d6 die bonus per 2 MP to attribute checks made to resist or breach a spell effect of the specified type.\r\n\r\nDispel Magic. Cost varies. You can only dispel an effect if its area of effect is within range. You must devote the same amount of MP to the Dispel Magic effect, in addition to MP paid for range, area of effect, duration, etc, as the caster of the spell you are trying to dispel. The more MP you spend, the more powerful effects you can dispel. The check is a MAGIC check directly opposed by the caster’s MAGIC check. In many cases, the caster’s MAGIC check may have been made previously, and should be recorded as the difficulty of the effect.\r\n\r\nAntimagic. Cost 5 MP. You can create an antimagic area, making it difficult or impossible for all magic to work within. You must spend a minimum of 5 MP to create antimagic, in addition to area of effect, range, and duration. You make a MAGIC check as normal, and any spells or effects cast within that area must exceed that check as a difficulty value or have that magic countered. Whenever any spell or effect enters the area, or its area of effect intersects the antimagic area, its controller makes the check against this effective difficulty benchmark. Obviously, an antimagic area will not suppress itself.\r\n\r\nTargeted Antimagic. Cost 1 MP. As Antimagic, except that you choose a single magical skill and the antimagic effect only applies to spells which use that skill. You can therefore create a cheaper anti-scrying area or other specific defense.\r\n\r\n## Hedging\r\n\r\nHedging. Cost 1 MP. You must declare a creature type (fey, goblinoid, beast, etc.) or virtue (such as Good or Evil). Creatures with the declared type or virtue who try to enter the area of effect or try to target MENTAL DEFENSE of creatures within the area are subject to a MAG vs. MENTAL DEFENSE attack; if it succeeds, the hedged creature cannot enter the protected area for one minute. Every minute it can make one attempt; if the creature fails, it is stuck outside for at least the next minute. This effect prevents the creature from making melee attacks into the area, but it can still use ranged attacks and spells which don’t target MENTAL DEFENSE.\r\n\r\nHedging, All. Cost 2 MP. As Hedging, but it applies to all creatures. This uses abjure self.\r\n\r\nHedging, Enduring. Cost 3 MP. You can only use this option in combination with Hedging or Hedging, All. Affected creatures only get one chance every day to enter the area, rather than once per minute. Of course, if the duration is less than a day, this benefit is slightly reduced.\r\n\r\nHedging, Greater. Cost 2 MP. You can only use this option in combination with Hedging or Hedging, All. None of the hedged creature’s attacks, spells, or abilities can cross into the area of effect.\r\n\r\n## Shielding\r\n\r\nShielding. Cost 1 MP per +2 DEFENSE. This a deflection ability; attacks of the secret’s type are diverted away from the target. Affected creatures gain a bonus to their DEFENSE against any selected creature type equal to the MP spent. To gain DEFENSE against all creature types, the cost is 1 MP/+1 DEFENSE and uses abjure self.\r\n\r\nWithstanding. Cost 1 MP per +2 SOAK. This enables the target to withstand the damage type of the secret; it does not deflect it away. Affected creatures gain a bonus to their SOAK score vs. any selected damage type equal to the MP spent. To gainSOAK against all damage types, the cost is 1 MP per +1 SOAK instead, and the spell uses abjure self.",

          "Markdown": "# Advanced Starship Combat\r\n\r\n## Newtonian Movement\r\n\r\nNewtonian movement is an optional way to deal with ship movement on a hex grid.\r\n\r\nAs normal, the ship's SPEED score tells you how much it can increase or decrease its velocity by each turn. A ship at zero velocity may rotate one hex side per turn for free.\r\n\r\nTurning does not cost any movement. It takes place for free, but there are limits on how fast you can turn based on your ship's overall agility and current velocity. A fast moving carrier has a very wide turning circle, while a tiny fighter can change direction much more easily.\r\n\r\nA ship's turning circle is equal to its speed multiplied by its class, divided by 10 (round down to a minimum of 1). A class XI ship moving at a velocity of 6 has a turning circle of 11 x 6 / 10 = 6. A smaller Class V scout moving at the same velocity has a turning circle of 3.\r\n\r\nThe turning circle value simply represents the number of hexes in a straight line that a ship can move in its turn before turning one hex side.\r\n\r\nNote that tactical combat speeds do not use the same scale as navigational combat speeds for SUB-L travel, although both are based on the same SPEED score. For this reason, time dilation is not a factor in combat, and a ship is not limited to a velocity of 25.\r\n\r\n## The Newtonian Round\r\n\r\nThe round structure for Newtonian movement differs slightly to that of regular movement. All movement takes place simultaneously, followed by all actions. The Newtonian round looks like this:\r\n\r\n1. All ships make INITIATIVE checks.\r\n2. All ships move in reverse INITIATIVE order (starting with the ship which lost).\r\n3. All PCs and ships then take actions in forward INITIATIVE order.\r\n4. Return to Step 1.\r\n\r\nThis sequence creates more realistic movement, but allows ships which win INITIATIVE to make tactical movement decisions based on what they see their opponents doing. The movement takes place simultaneously, but is resolved in reverse order to give an informational advantage to faster ships.",

Slatherbeasts can stomp on an adjacent prone opponent as a free action. This is an attack, and does 5d6 blunt damage.\r\nGrab. Slatherbeasts can grab opponents of size Medium or smaller when making a claw attack.  A creature struck by the grab attack is Restrained and remains so until escape.  The slatherbeast can maintain two grabs at any time. Victims grabbed automatically take 3d6+6 blunt damage at the start of their turn.\r\nSwallow whole. A Slatherbeast can transfer a grabbed victim to its mouth with a further attack.  If this attack fails, the victim is dropped and escapes. If it is successful, the victim is swallowed whole, taking 5d6+7 piercing damage in the process. The interior of a slatherbeast is intensely hot, causing 4d6 heat damage per round to the creature's victims.  Escaping from within is almost impossible, given the beast's armoured stomach (its SOAK applies within, also) designed to eat anything in the universe, but if that SOAK can be exceeded, then 20 damage in single attack will free the swallowed creature. If still alive, a swallowed creature can be freed from a dead slatherbeast; the heat damage ceases upon the slatherbeast's death.\r\nRoar. Slatherbeasts can unleash a roar so loud that its victims are stricken with fear as a 6d6 mental attack within Burst 11.  Victims successfully attacked are made Afraid. This attack affects any within range who can hear the creature, whether or not they can see it.\r\nQuake. The creature slams a foot, fist, or tail on the ground, shaking the area within 6 squares. The creature makes a 6d6 melee attack against everybody within the area, knocking targets prone and doing 1d6 damage to them.\r\nSentience. One in a thousand slatherbeasts are sentient, with LOG attributes of 4 (2d6) and the ability to speak.  Some slatherbeasts are domesticated and used for warfare - these creatures are frequently armored and trained, gaining the tactics skill at 3 (2d6) and a SOAK of 20. There are even rumours of highly intelligent, psionic slatherbeasts.",

The creatures can move on walls and ceilings normally.\r\nPounce. The Facehugger can jump up to 12’ horizonatally, or 6’ vertically, to attack its victim. On a successful attack, it attaches itself to the victim’s face; the victim gains the Restrained condition at severe level (requiring a 6 to remove). Each round that the victim begins its turn grabbed, he takes 3d6+3 damage, which cannot be SOAKED.  When reduced to zero HEALTH, the victim falls unconscious, but does not form a death countdown - the Facehugger keeps its prey alive and impregnates it. Any damage to the Facehugger at this time does damage to the victim, also, making it very hard to dislodge (although an extended Strenuous [25] LOG (medicine) task with one-hour intervals will do it).  The Facehugger leaves the victim after 24 hours. The victim, now impregnated, forms a 3d6 hourly countdown pool.

Any injury which penetrates the xenomorph’s hide causes a splash of acid blood, which does 1d6 damage to anybody within 5-feet of the creature.  Additionally, the blood itself, should it come into contact with other materials, is able to eat through metal, doing 5d6 acid damage per round.\r\nTail Swipe. The xenomorph can perform a tail swipe with its barbed tail. This affects a 10-ft cone, and knocks targets prone.\r\nPoison. A xenomorph’s attack renders the target Poisoned. A victim reduced to zero HEALTH is not killed, but is dragged off and cocooned in a membrane of salvia and resin, to be used as an incubator for Facehuggers.\r\nDeath from on High.

A hit with the barbed tail penetrates the victim, and inflicts the Restrained condition, requires an attack to escape. The tail automatically inflicts 5d6+6 damage at the start of the grabbed creature’s turns.\r\nRoar. The Matriarch can emit a roar with Burst 10, which does does a mental attack, inflicting the Afraid condition.\r\nLiving Shield. The Matriarch picks up another creature smaller than itself and uses it as a shield. The target can escape the grab as normal.

There is no typical appearance for an Android, and they might feature wheels, legs, or more.\r\n\r\nWhile many philosophers will debate whether or not Androids have true consciousness, they have passed every test imaginable and are legally considered to be sentient, and alive, with all the rights and responsibilities that entails.\r\n\r\nStronger and tougher than humans, with processors which can outpace the human mind, Androids aren’t always the most popular in the room. Androids do not usually exist as a separate culture (although at least one world is known to be populated exclusively by Androids).\r\n\r\nAndroids make excellent scientists, engineers, and doctors.\r\n\r\n## Statistics\r\n\r\nSize/type: Small, medium, or large; mechanoid\r\n\r\nAttributes: STR +2, LOG +2, PSI –\r\n\r\nSkill choices: computers, engineering, running, linguistics, [technical]\r\n\r\n## Exploits\r\n\r\n- Mechanoid. Androids share the same range of traits as other mechanoids: they are immune to any attacks which target MENTAL DEFENSE; an Android’s PSI attribute can never rise above zero, and an Android cannot spend LUC dice to gain bonus dice when making attributes; Androids are vulnerable (1d6) to electricity damage, and vulnerable (2d6) to ion damage, and Androids do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe.\r\n- Ageless. Androids do not age, do not have an age category, or access to age-based exploits.\r\n- Modification. Choose two of the following modification exploits. Androids can take the Android-only Systems Upgrade universal exploit at any time to gain additional modifications.\r\n\r\n## Modification Exploits\r\n\r\nAndroids choose two of the following exploits.\r\n\r\n- 360-degree Sensors. The Android has visual sensors which cover a full 360-degree circle, or a fully rotating head or sensor apparatus, giving it all-round sight. It is not affected by crossfire or flanking.\r\n- Access Ports. The Android can “plug in” to a computer or computerized system, granting it a +1d6 bonus to computer checks.\r\n- Armor. The Android is plated with armor, giving it SOAK 5. The Android’s weight is 200% normal instead of 150%, and it cannot swim (sinking to the bottom of any liquid, although it does not need to breathe and can walk on the bottom).\r\n- Carrying Capacity. The Android doubles its carrying capacity.\r\n- Chameleon System. The chameleon system allows the Android to change color to match its environment, granting it +1d6 to stealth-based attribute checks.\r\n- Chrome Skin. The Android has a chrome skin which grants it +5 SOAK vs. heat damage (not compatible with Organic Appearance).\r\n- Compute. The Android can absorb a large document (the equivalent of a major novel or textbook) in a minute, or make complex calculations, including FTL calculations which require no check at FTL factors equal to or lower than the Android’s LOG attribute.\r\n- Durable Infrastructure. The Android gains 3d6 HEALTH.\r\n- Electrical Discharge. The Android can shock a target by using a regular unarmed attack; this increases the Android’s unarmed damage by +1d6 and changes it to electricity damage. If this exploit is taken a second time, the electrical discharge can be upgraded to a ranged attack with a range increment of 4.\r\n- Forcefield. The Android can generate a protective forcefield which operates just like a worn forcefield generator. It grants the Android +2 DEFENSE, but takes an action to activate and can only operate for one minute at a time before needing an hour to recharge.\r\n- Improved Armor (requires Armor). While the base armor is a steel composite which gives SOAK 5, further upgrades can improve the Android’s armor by another +1 SOAK per upgrade. This exploit can be taken multiple times.\r\n- Infrared Sensors. The Android’s visual sensors can see in the dark as well as in the light. The Android effectively gains superior darksight.\r\n- Integrated Equipment. Gear like fire extinguishers, communicators, even magboots or parachutes can be integrated into the Android.\r\n- Organic Appearance. The Android has an outer covering resembling a human (or other species) although not so alike that it would fool anyone. This is achieved from synthetic or organic tissue which covers the interior endoskeleton. Any injury will clearly reveal the Android’s true nature, as will any interaction for more than a minute or so. This is not the same level of detail as a Synthetic, which (as a race) is far more convincing as a human.\r\n- Memory Backup. If the Android’s body is destroyed, its memories and personality may still be accessed, and, indeed, placed in a new Android body. The new body has its own attributes and exploits, but the old character’s skills and memories. To do this, an engineer must make a LOG check with a difficulty equal to three times the Android’s grade.\r\n- Memory Wipe. An Android can have its memory wiped and a new factory-default base skillset installed. The Android’s attributes remain the same, but it loses all of its skills. Total up the Android’s current skill point total, and then divide them evenly between five newly selected skills. The unfortunate side-effect of this procedure, of course, is that the Android loses all its memories.\r\n- Mimicry. The Android has a voice synthesizer which can mimic any voice or sound.\r\n- Multiple Legs. The Android has four or more legs. It ignores difficult terrain.\r\n- Protocol Package. The Android is able to read, speak, and understand any language fluently. This does not enable it to break codes, cyphers, or encrypted data, however.\r\n- Rocket Boosters. The Android’s JUMP scores increase to 30' horizontally and vertically.\r\n- Repair Nanites. Once per day, the Android can activate its repair nanites to recover 2d6 HEALTH. This costs two actions.\r\n- Scanner. The Android has an inbuilt scanner (equal to a hand scanner) which it is always considered to be carrying. This scanner might be part of its body, or simply part of its sensory equipment, and may or may not be visible.\r\n- Self-destruct System. While not popular with intelligent Androids, self-destruct systems do exist. They can be combined with a memory backup. When an Android self-destructs, it spends two actions to activate the systems and then explodes at the start of its next turn. It causes 1d6 heat damage per size category to all within 30'. Alternatively, it is possible to automate the self-destruct system to activate when the Android reaches zero HEALTH.\r\n- Tracks (requires Wheels). Wheels can be upgraded to Treads, which removes the difficult terrain penalty.\r\n- Weapon Integration. The Android has some kind of ranged or melee weapon integrated into its body. Choose a weapon from the core rules. The weapon must be the same size category as the Android or smaller, and worth 100cr or less. This exploit can be taken multiple times to incorporate multiple weapons, or to double the value of the weapon each time (so taking it three times results in a weapon with a value of up to 400cr).\r\n- Wheels. The Android moves on wheels instead of legs. This reduces its SPEED to 2 across difficult terrain, but increases its SPEED by 2 on normal terrain.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oA3jd-8WXH5TdvOnDqTjtIgxsC6MeWZwZOOalGETkdUbjaK0_MvdrKzxWxnEWlEwz2zFOEEtn14Pecw7EXAit-3IkSlWhNBWGQsLA2q0iMdDftuF=w1280)",

The concept was proposed by the physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, in which he suggested that an advanced civilization might use such a structure capture 100% of its star’s energy. Variations on the concept include Dyson swarms (billions of constructs orbiting in dense formation around a star), Dyson bubbles, and Dyson rings.\r\n\r\nRingworld.

Most galaxies, including the Milky Way, contain a supermassive black hole at their core, about which the entire galaxy orbits. A black hole is a region of space-time which has such a high gravitational pull that even light cannot escape it; they can be formed by the collapse of supermassive stars at the end of their lives, and can continue to grow by eating matter and energy that strays too close. Of course, just like a star, if you don’t get too close you can quite happily orbit a black hole without being pulled in.\r\n\r\nA black hole is usually surrounded by an accretion disk of material spiralling in towards the event horizon. This disk can heat up to incredible temperatures, and consequently provide enough heat and light that the black hole may actually function as a sun.\r\n\r\nIf a ship should find itself within the event horizon of a black hole, it takes 1d6 superstructure damage per round as gravitational forces stretch and pull at it. However, it can escape by moving at greater than lightspeed; this requires a LOG check (bolstered by either the piloting or physics skills).\r\n\r\nSize \t\tFTL \t\tCheck\r\n\r\nRegular \t1 \t\t\tStrenuous [25]\r\n\r\nLarge \t\t5 \t\t\tSevere [29]\r\n\r\nMassive \t10 \t\t\tHerculean [33]\r\n\r\nBlack holes also cause time dilation based on a vessel’s distance from the event horizon. While the details of this depend on its mass, rate of spin, and many other factors, for a regular black hole a distance of 1AU is considered safe.\r\n\r\nPlanets can orbit black holes at safe distances. If they are within 1AU, they will also experience time dilation.\r\n\r\nDouble the distances for a large black hole, and multiply by 5 for a massive black hole. Orbits can be assumed to be safe at a distance of 1 AU from an event horizon, meaning that you can have planets orbiting safely but within the time dilation zone of a larger black hole.\r\n\r\nDistance (AU)\\* \tDilation\r\n\r\n1 \t\t\t\tnone\r\n\r\n0.75 \t\t\tx2\r\n\r\n0.5 \t\t\tx10\r\n\r\n0.25 \t\t\tx25\r\n\r\n0 \t\t\t\tinfinite\r\n\r\n\\*from the event horizon",

          "Markdown": "# Borian\r\n\r\nWelcome in most places, Borians are short, brightly colored humanoids with bald, spiked heads. Standing about 4-feet in height, Borians are sturdy, although not especially broad, weighing about 140 pounds. Blue Borians are stockier than Red Borians, while Red Borians are a little taller on average. A Borian’s skull is thick, and their bald heads are covered with spiky, bony protrusions. Male Borians almost always sport beards, which are almost always white; like the mythological Dwarves of human culture, a male Borian without a beard feels naked and exposed.\r\n\r\nWhile not as long-lived as the Venetians, Borians do live extremely long lives. For all their technological bent, Borians do not tend to engage with life-extending  procedures. Most Borians live to about 250 years of age. Indeed, a Borian is not considered old until she reaches around 210 years. Both Red and Blue Borians reach maturity at the age of 90. There is little visible change in a Borian’s appearance between the ages of 90 and 210, which makes it very hard to guess a Borian’s age. However, they do prize age and respect their elders, and will proudly tell you how many years they have been alive. Borians regard age as a measure of experience, and aspire to be like those older than themselves.\r\n\r\nBorians famously come in two colors—red, and blue. This is no more consequential than skin color in humans, although it has in the past caused tensions and even conflict. Red and blue Borians are extremely similar, though there are some minor differences.\r\n\r\nBorians have a reputation for good cheer and friendliness. This, coupled with their naturally robust constitution, also makes them renowned drinkers, and it has been said that Borians make the most common bartender race in the universe.\r\n\r\n## Statistics\r\n\r\nSize/type: Small; humanoid\r\n\r\nAttributes: END +1, INT +1, CHA +1, REP +1\r\n\r\nSkill choices: carousing, hardy, [crafting], engineering, appraisal\r\n\r\n## Exploits\r\n\r\n- Darksight. Borians can see in the dark to a distance of 10' per point of INT.\r\n- Iron Constitution. Borians are not affected by poisons, including alcohol. They are also immune to radiation damage and radiation sickness.\r\n- Tinkerers. Borians may designate one item of equipment which they own. That item permanently gains one bonus quality level. If the item is lost or destroyed, the Borian may designate a new item after 24 hours.\r\n- Long-lived. When creating a Borian character, multiply their career lengths by 3.\r\n- Personable. Borians are noted for their cheerful demeanor and likability. When taking a new career, a Borian may optionally exchange one of the listed four attribute increases for CHA, as long as it doesn’t result in a duplicate attribute advancement.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ecSR633-9u_x8gV9wF8EUOMAiBNoX7XIwsoPYiYHinP0bpbdkC8Fa2RISOQIMgxIsfmEi9Q1FK7sZSpqCx-dPsB5WN5FhXufVOCHSDKq8CFylECS=w1280)",

The side of the phone contains an extending coil of filament that operates as an autopick.\r\n\r\nFingerprinter. The brilliant phone is able to scan, analyze, and then transmit a fingerprint pressed against it. Furthermore, the gadget is able to use a scanned fingerprint to fool an electronic lock (so long as the electronic lock uses fingerprint scanning).\r\n\r\nIdentifier. The brilliant phone can make a composite facial image from a single clear photograph of a subject, then reference it through databases to identify them within 5 minutes (provided they have records in the relevant database).\r\n\r\nStun Gun. The brilliant phone can be used as a taser, both to damage unauthorized users and as a melee weapon. It does 1d6 electricity damage.\r\n\r\nVehicular Remote. The brilliant phone may be used to drive a vehicle rigged with a control device (costing $2,000).

          "Markdown": "# Careers\r\n\r\nCareers are occupations held by characters over the course of their lives. Characters may hold multiple careers over a period of many years, and gain knowledge and skills from each.\r\n\r\nWhat’s O.L.D. Is N.E.W. uses a “life-path” system to create and advance characters. Characters begin play with five careers. Choose one origin and four further careers. When you choose a career, you gain attribute increases, skill ranks, and access to unique exploits.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nCareers sometimes have prerequisites, which can be thought of as qualifications—demonstrated competence in a given area. Specific game settings may have more stringent prerequisites; for example, a secret spy organization might require that a character complete an army tour before becoming a secret agent. The GM should inform players of any setting-based prerequisites such as organizational career ladders.\r\n\r\n## Skills\r\n\r\nCharacters may choose two skills from each career grade. Defensive skills—for example, *acrobatics, bravery, concentration, conviction, discipline, dodging, foresight, leadership, meditation, psychology, religion*, and *rulership*—are always available. Listings in *[square brackets]* indicate categories; the character may choose a skill from the indicated category or create a new, relevant skill.\r\n\r\nA completed grade 5 character will have a total of 13 skill ranks (3 race skills and 2 career skills per grade).\r\n\r\n## Attributes\r\n\r\nCharacters advance 4 attribute points from each career grade. Apply all listed attribute adjustments.\r\n\r\n## Exploits\r\n\r\nChoose one of the listed exploits for your career or select a universal exploit. You may only choose a given exploit once, unless that exploit specifically indicates otherwise. Some exploits require prerequisites, which are noted in their description—you must meet that prerequisite before selecting the exploit. Occasionally, an exploit may appear in more than one career; you may still only select it once, even if you choose both careers.\r\n\r\n## Repeating Careers\r\n\r\nYou can take careers multiple times (except after you have taken a career other than your origin, you cannot take your origin again). Each time you take the career, you choose two skills, apply the attribute increases again, and select one of the available exploits. Once you have exhausted all of the listed exploits through repetition of a career, you may select a universal exploit instead when you advance a grade in that career.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DzLq2pTeUBXMNgSC16wG_j5UByskHJMbyW4CkEY8zUwdtq8RiiKuD5Z0zBYjL7mEm-pjUUN7CFoNCt2Vhi92t7QNvSJPb9LFzgn2Of-TYCQBT0EY=w1280)\r\n\r\n## [Fantasy Careers](/characters/careers/fantasy-careers)\r\n\r\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qLx-Km_DpnoeZOl7kjeQHRE_bzp_5ZzLUUeC-LFH_uWCMD8L3EC_Ao2zbNx12MlHPCFKrtws0YqO9kf2-3yEb12QrQi7UL5n76My9R9qxXKJqVS2=w1280)\r\n\r\n## [Modern Careers](/characters/careers/modern-careers)\r\n\r\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3S1kd68hjl35CrX7pIjCCHmDronnPD0QaFmKWqQpduzrO2zvyjKtKpYVyEQdHHZlZ0RE73ESTVHb57E_An0oCGL98-WTguE52G9wkAlWGcTILGu2=w1280)\r\n\r\n## [Future Careers](/characters/careers/future-careers)",

          "Markdown": "# Casting A Spell\r\n\r\nTo cast a spell, you must know the secret associated with the spell, you must have enough Magic Points available to cast it, and your Magic attribute must be at least equal to the MP cost of the spell.\r\n\r\nCasting a spell costs one action and requires a MAG attribute check equal to 10 + the spell’s MP cost, unless it targets an unwilling creature, in which case a MAG attack vs. the creature’s Ranged, Mental, or Vital Defense must be made instead, or unless the spell performs an action for which an attribute check would normally be required (such as picking a lock). If two or more of these things apply, the highest is used.\r\n\r\nThe minimum difficulty of a spell is 10. For example, a spell which simply creates a wall of stone across a passageway requires a MAG check equal to 10 + the spell’s MP. The magic-user then deducts the cost of the spell from his current MP pool, and the spell is cast. Firing a bolt of fire at a goblin requires the magic-user to make a ranged Magic attack at the goblin, and unlocking a locked door requires a check vs. the difficulty to pick the door’s lock.\r\n\r\nSpell Difficulty = 10 + MP Cost\r\n(or target’s Defense, whichever is higher)\r\n\r\nComponents. Spells require verbal (spoken) and somatic (physical) components, meaning that in order to cast a spell, the caster must be able to move and speak freely. Certain exploits can eliminate the need for these components.\r\n\r\n## Designing a Spell\r\n\r\nMagic-users can create spells on the fly using the verb-noun (skill-secret) system. Spells combine skills with secrets (fire, air, blood, demon, undead, ice, plant, beast, etc.) to create an effect defined by the skill(s) and secret(s) involved.\r\n\r\nA magic-user can use compulsion and the secret of undead to compel undead, but not to compel animals or summon undead. A spell might use the skill abjuration and the secret of undead to create an effect (abjure undead) which protects the caster from the undead. Similarly, a create fire spell can light a candle.\r\n\r\n## Basic Spell (Cantrip)\r\n\r\nA basic spell  which costs 0 MP, is as follows.\r\n\r\nCost                           0 MP\r\n\r\nCasting Time        1 action\r\n\r\nDuration                 1 round\r\n\r\nRange                       Touch or self\r\n\r\nTarget                       One creature, object, point in space, or 5' square\r\n\r\nEffect                        One action (e.g. open a door, light a candle, deal 1 point of damage, move 1 lb.)\r\n\r\nCheck                       10+ MP cost; but unwilling creatures require an attack roll using the caster’s MAG attribute\r\n\r\nListed below are example uses of 0 MP cantrips for each skill in order to give a sense of what is appropriate for a minor effect associated with such a spell.\r\n\r\nAn abjuration cantrip can grant a simple 1 point of Soak against a specific damage type for up to one round. This is enough to provide basic environmental protection against non-extreme conditions.\r\n\r\n- A compulsion cantrip can allow you to issue a simple one-word command to a target or send a one-word telepathic message to an ally.\r\n- A creation cantrip can create a tiny object worth no more than 5 gc which lasts for up to one round.\r\n- A divination cantrip can read tea leaves, throw bones, do a tarot reading, or other divination implements, to answer a single yes/no question, but this can only be done once per day. Alternatively, it can be used to detect the presence of (but not the exact location or details of) a creature, element, or virtue within 5'.\r\n- An enchantment cantrip can make a target feel a very weak emotion for up to one round.\r\n- An evocation cantrip can do 1 point of damage.\r\n- A healing cantrip can heal one point of Health; a given target can benefit from this once per day.\r\n- A hex cantrip can inflict a –1 penalty to all Defense attributes for up to one round.\r\n- An illusion cantrip can create a small, clearly illusory effect for up to one round.\r\n- An infusion cantrip can cause a creature to detect as the appropriate alignment or element for up to one round.\r\n- An affliction cantrip can cause a feeling of slight nausea for up to one round.\r\n- A movement cantrip can move a 1-pound object within a 5' area.\r\n- A displacement cantrip can cause a slight blurring effect, granting +1 to Defense for up to one round.\r\n- A summoning cantrip can summon a tiny, harmless creature like a mouse or rat for up to one round; it has no special intelligence or abilities.\r\n- A transformation cantrip can change the color of an object or target or other minor cosmetic changes for up to one round.\r\n\r\n## Improving Your Spell\r\n\r\nUse the table below to increase duration, range, target, and casting time by spending MP. You cannot spend more MP on one spell than your MAGIC attribute.\r\n\r\n[Try the Spell Builder](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.enworld.org%2Ftools%2Fspell.php&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw3UvaEAIlM0zEwvzYZ7GZMU)\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xrY7PkL1MQeODqJJicUxOi9rEDce8N6NMyhZTdr2DG0VhoJmivSFS3yzlrNekX5WbnVRpZJk3b0o-lCYwbF-ntwQFaenSfiKNuGJAnlWKL_ivgDaUnXuSRErq2Bxcf8bPA=w1280)\r\n\r\n## Spell Enhancements\r\n\r\nIn additon to duration, range, area, and casting time, you can spend MP on specific effects. These are categorised into different skills (Abjuration, Evocation, etc.) although you do not need skill ranks in that skill to use those effects as long as you have the MP to spend. However, if you do have ranks in those skills, your attribute checks to cast spells will benefit from them.\r\n\r\n- General Enhancements\r\n- Abjuration Enhancement\r\n- Compulsion Enhancements\r\n- Creation Enhancements\r\n- Divination Enhancements\r\n- Enchantment Enhancements\r\n- Evocation Enhancements\r\n- Healing Enhancements\r\n- Hex Enhancements\r\n- Illusion Enhancements\r\n- Infliction Enhancements\r\n- [Infusion Enhancements](http://infsio)\r\n- Movement Enhancements\r\n- Summon Enhancements\r\n- Transformation Enhancements",

          "Markdown": "# Advancement\r\n\r\nThroughout a campaign, characters will advance. They will gain or improve skills, acquire new exploits, and increase attributes. Characters have two 'currencies' to spend on advancement.\r\n\r\nTime. A character can take a new career grade by spending the required time (usually 1d6 years, but the career itself will provide specific information). This type of advancement requires downtime – periods in which a character's activities take place in the background - and it advances a character's age. If time is spent, no XP expenditure is needed.\r\n\r\nCharacters can always spend more than the minimum time indicated - the indicated time is an optimum adventurer hero progression.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, NPCs may take much longer to progress; it is not unusual to see old NPCs with only a few career ranks.\r\n\r\nExperience points. The GM awards experience points (XP) for overcoming challenges, defeating enemies, and completing milestones. These XP can be spent on new career grades. The XP cost of a career grade is equal to 10 times the new grade – deduct the XP from the character's total when he spends them. If XP are spent, no time expenditure is needed.\r\n\r\nAdvancements are accessed via career grades, and contextualize any given improvement.\r\n\r\n## Defeating Enemies & Overcoming Challenges\r\n\r\nThe core advancement assumption is that you need to defeat or overcome 10 encounters of Medium difficulty to advance to the next grade. The XP requirement for each grade is equal to ten times the next grade. For a Medium difficulty encounter, characters gain XP equal to their own grade.\r\n\r\nThe GM evaluates how difficult the players found the encounter and awards XP accordingly. Round down when calculating half grade values.\r\n\r\nDifficulty \t\t\tSlow \tFast\r\n\r\nTrivial \t\t\t\t0 \t\tNo XP\r\n\r\nEasy \t\t\t\t2 \t\tHalf grade (round down)\r\n\r\nMedium \t\t\t5 \t\tEqual to grade\r\n\r\nHard \t\t\t\t10 \t\tTwo times grade\r\n\r\nExtremely hard \t15 \t\tThree times grade\r\n\r\nGMs are free to set different advancement rates. Changing the speed of character advancement can affect the tone of a campaign, and the GM should be sure to inform the players before play what the campaign's advancement rate is. To set a different advancement rate, simply increase or decrease the cost of a new career grade from 10 XP per grade to a higher or lower value.\r\n\r\n## Planning\r\n\r\nIf the PCs research and plan to the extent where they make a supposedly difficult encounter into easier encounter by virtue of their preparations and forethought, they are awarded XP for an encounter level higher (e.g. an encounter which turned out to be Easy because of good planning becomes a Medium encounter for the purposes of XP awards). XP awards for good planning require GM discretion, and ensures that players are not penalized for thinking their way around a problem.\r\n\r\n## Completing Milestones\r\n\r\nThe GM awards XP for completing major storyline milestones. Milestones are major non-combat challenges or obstacles which have required substantial effort on the part of the characters. This award is equal to the character's existing grade (the same as for a Medium encounter). A grade 5 character, therefore, receives 5 XP for completing a milestone. Milestones are fairly arbitrary, but a good guideline is to include one in every session of play.\r\n\r\n## Incremental Advances\r\n\r\nSometimes a character increases just her STR attribute by working out, or just her pistols skill at the shooting range. To do this, the character needs to spend XP. The cost of the increase is equal to three times the new score – so an increase from 9 to 10 STR costs 30 XP, while an increase from rank 2 to rank 3 in pistols costs 9 XP. The XP is deducted from the character's total XP.\r\n\r\nA universal exploit (but not a career exploit) can be purchased for half the price of a new grade.\r\n\r\nYou cannot spend time to make incremental advances; you must spend XP. Only full career grades can be purchased with time. Incremental advances take place in the background at the same time as regular activity, and are assumed to have involved current and prior training. Therefore a character gains the benefit of an incremental advance immediately upon spending the XP.\r\n\r\nIncremental advances are not as cost effective as career grades, but they allow for fine-tuning and granular advancement. Note, however, that a character's maximum dice pool is always based on his overall grade, so incremental advancements should always be viewed as a supplementary advancement method.",

          "Markdown": "# Age\r\n\r\nYour age is determined by the total of your character's years in each career. Age falls into three broad bands – **young**, **adult**, and **old**.\r\n\r\nIf you are *young* or *old*, you get a free age exploit. Choose any synonym for that word and insert it into your descriptor. It's up to you what adjective you choose. If you are *adult*, you do not need to add it to your descriptor.\r\n\r\n## Adding Years\r\n\r\nYou may always add extra years to your age during character creation. In cinematic mode, adult characters gain an additional LUC die and old characters gain a further LUC die.\r\n\r\n## Young Characters\r\n\r\nYoung characters are characterized by curiosity and brashness. You gain one of the following exploits. You lose the exploit when you are no longer categorized as young.\r\n\r\n- **Brash.** Once per day, when rolling a dice pool, you may declare it to be an exploding dice pool. Any 6s that you roll may be rolled again, the new roll adding to the existing 6. If you roll a 6 again, repeat, until you roll less than a 6.\r\n- **Ignorance is Bliss.** Sometimes it's better to just not know. When you first meet a creature type you have not met before, you gain +1d6 to attack that creature until it first attacks you and makes you know better. You do not gain this bonus against that creature type thereafter.\r\n- **Recuperation.**Young people heal quickly; whenever you recieve healing, add 1 point of HEALTH per full die of healing.\r\n- **Youthful Exuberance.**Young people are resilient to damage. Once per day you, when you take damage, you may reduce that damage by half.\r\n\r\n## Old Characters\r\n\r\nOld characters are characterized by experience. Old characters can no longer improve physical attributes (STR, AGI, END) through career advances or experience expenditure, although they may do so via other means (magic, cybernetics, etc.) You gain one of the following exploits.\r\n\r\n- **Broad Knowledge Base.** You’ve learned a lot over the years. Choose five skills which you do not already know; you gain those skills at 3 ranks (2d6).\r\n- **Careful.**Once per day, when rolling a dice pool, you may declare it to be a careful dice pool. Any 1s that you roll may be rerolled, with the new roll replacing the 1. If you roll a 1 a second time, however, you must keep the 1.\r\n- **Mentor.**You are able to pass your experience on to those younger than you. Once per day, you may replenish the LUC pool of a young ally by spending five minutes offering sage words.\r\n- **Old Dog.** Old characters are often set in their ways. You gain +4 MENTAL DEFENSE.\r\n- **Old Friends.**An old character will have made many friends over the years. Choose a skill; you have an old friend with 3d6 ranks in that skill. As long as you have some way to communicate with your friend and ask for their advice, you effectively gain the benefit of that skill. It takes five minutes to acquire the advice, and it must pertain to one specific task you intend to carry out within the next day.\r\n- **Poison Immunity.** You’ve eaten and drunk everything known to man, and many things not. You have developed a complete immunity to poisons.\r\n- **Resistances.** Over the years, you’ve been exposed to many illnesses and built up a resistance. Any time you would normally be affected by an illness or disease, you may make a LUC check vs. the difficulty rating of the disease; on a success, the disease does not affect you.\r\n- **Seen It All Before.** You’ve seen so much in your life. You are immune to the Afraid condition.\r\n- **Seen That One Before.** It can be a hard to surprise an older person. You become immune to ambushes.\r\n- **This Old Trick.** You know some old tricks which youngsters may not be aware of. You gain a bonus LUC die.\r\n- **Wizened.** You are old - and you look it! Fortunately, this works in your favor, granting you +1d6 to CHA checks vs. young people.",

You may also add your *running* dice pool if you have that skill.\r\n\r\nFor *climbing, swimming*,*zero-g, high-g,*etc. replace the *running* skill and **halve the final total** unless an exploit tells you otherwise.\r\n\r\nSmall (or smaller) characters suffer a -1 penalty to SPEED.\r\n\r\n## JUMP\r\n\r\nThis is the distance and height you may jump automatically. It should be recorded on your character sheet in units of feet, not squares (unlike SPEED) in the format 7'/4'.\r\n\r\nYour horizontal jump is equal to twice your AGI attribute in feet.\r\n\r\nYour vertical jump is equal to your STR attribute in feet, but cannot exceed your horizontal jump.\r\n\r\nThese values assume a 10' run-up. From a standing start, they are halved.\r\n\r\n## CARRY\r\n\r\nYour basic carry increment is equal to STR + END multiplied by 10. Record the value in pounds. If you have *carry* skill, you may add this (the raw value, not the dice pool) before the multiplier. Each carry increment inflicts a -1d6 penalty to physical attribute checks and -1 to SPEED. No matter how many increments are applied, you cannot carry more than your max deadlift (below).\r\n\r\nThe maximum lift for a creature is 50 lbs times its STR attribute (adding *carry* if necessary). Note that a creature's max lift capacity is not a comfortable carrying weight; a creature cannot move holding its max lift, and can only hold it for a number of rounds equal to its END attribute.\r\n\r\nLarge creatures like Ogres gain a +50% bonus to carrying values.\r\n\r\n## INITIATIVE\r\n\r\nInitiative measures how quickly you can react in combat situations. It is equal to your INT dice pool. You may also add *tactics* or *reactions* dice pools. In starship combat, *starship tactics* is used instead.\r\n\r\n## DEFENSES\r\n\r\nA character has four DEFENSE scores: MELEE DEFENSE, RANGED DEFENSE, MENTAL DEFENSE, and VITAL DEFENSE.\r\n\r\n*The minimum score for any DEFENSE is 10*, whatever the size and skill of the character. If a final DEFENSE score is lower than 10, increase it to 10.\r\n\r\nFor each DEFENSE score, form a dice pool consisting of attribute, skill, and equipment, as normal (and subject to the normal dice pool limit) and multiply the size of the pool by 3.5 (round up). For example, a 5d6 pool gives a DEFENSE of 18, which is the average roll for a dice pool of that size.\r\n\r\n### DEFENSE Dice Pool\r\n\r\n## (Attribute + Skill + Equipment ) x 3.5\r\n\r\ne.g. AGI (3d6) + *swords* (1d6) + high quality sword (1d6) = 5d6 = 18\r\n\r\nTo form the dice pool, use the following attributes and skills:\r\n\r\n### Attribute (use one)\r\n\r\n- For MELEE DEFENSE use the highest of your STR and AGI. This is used for most melee attacks.\r\n- For RANGED DEFENSE use your AGI. This is used for most single-target ranged attacks.\r\n- For MENTAL DEFENSE use the highest of CHA and WIL. This is used for most social and many psionic and magical attacks against the mind.\r\n- For VITAL DEFENSE, use END. This is used for called shots, area attacks, poisons, and other attack against the target's consitution.\r\n\r\n### Skill (use one)For MELEE and RANGED DEFENSE, you may use acrobatics, dodging, or foresight.\r\n\r\n- For MENTAL DEFENSE you may use *concentration, meditation*, *bravery, discipline, religion, conviction, leadership, psychology*, or *rulership*.\r\n- For VITAL DEFENSE you may use*resistance*,*fortitude*, or *survival.*\r\n\r\n### Equipment (use one)\r\n\r\n- For DEFENSE against melee and ranged attacks, the quality of your  armor, or shield (whichever is higher)  can be used in your dice pool, subject to normal skill limits on item quality.\r\n\r\nFinally, apply the following modifiers:\r\n\r\n### Size\r\n\r\n- Small characters get +2 to MELEE and RANGED, and -2 to VITAL.\r\n- Large characters get -4 to MELEE and RANGED and +2 to VITAL.\r\n\r\n### Shields & Armor\r\n\r\n- Small shields give +1, medium shields +2, and large shields +3.\r\n- Medium armor inflicts a -2 penalty, and heavy armor a -4 penalty. Light armor inflicts no penalty.\r\n\r\n## Starting Money\r\n\r\nRoll a REP dice pool and a LUC dice pool and multiply the result by 20.  If the final total is less than 100, increase your starting money to 100. You should now peruse the*Equipment*sections and purchase weapons, armor, and other equipment for your character. Record this on your character sheet.\r\n\r\nIf you have a career with a monthly wage, you may roll this each month.\r\n\r\n## Attacks\r\n\r\nFinally, note down your attacks. You should have two or three, depending on your equipment. The first is an unarmed attack (*brawling, boxing, wrestling, martial arts,* depending on skills) and the others might be a melee and a ranged weapon.\r\n\r\nAn attack is recorded in this format:\r\n\r\n***Laser pistol*** 3d6 (2d6+2 heat damage; range 12; *notes*)\r\n\r\nThe first value (3d6 in the example) is your attack roll. This is a dice pool formed as normal from attribute + skill + equipment.\r\n\r\n**Melee** attacks use STR or AGI.\r\n\r\n**Ranged** attacks use AGI or INT.\r\n\r\nThe damage value, range, and any notes are found in the weapon's entry.\r\n\r\n- Unarmed damage is 1d6 for size medium and smaller creatures, plus 1d6 for each size category above medium.\r\n- Note that Felans do 2d6 slashing damage with their claws when unarmed.\r\n- Add your unarmed skill dice pool size OR your STR dice pool size to unarmed damage as a flat bonus, using the dice pool size.\r\n- Add your relevant weapon skill dice pool size to weapon damage as a flat bonus, or your STR dice pool size for melee weapons.\r\n\r\nFor example, a Felan with 3 ranks in *martial arts* does 2d6+2 unarmed damaged.",

It can be anything, but it's designed to round out the character with personality, interests, or hobbies. For example, a player might choose “...who enjoys hard liquor” or “... who has a taste for romance” or even “...who collects insects as a hobby”. The hook works as a broad skill. Any time you make an attribute check, you can use the descriptor to make the dice pool explode. The GM should be generous in allowing this; the hook should provide a frequent reminder of a character's background.

A starting character with 5 career grades is grade 5, and has a maximum pool size of 5d6.\r\n\r\n- Player characters usually start play at Grade 5.\r\n\r\nSome NPCs, civilians, or weak monsters may be lower than grade 5, and their maximum dice pool is equal to their grade.\r\n\r\n## Maximum Dice Pools\r\n\r\nGrade\t\tMaximum DIce Pool (MDP)\r\n\r\n1\t\t\t1d6\r\n\r\n2\t\t\t2d6\r\n\r\n3\t\t\t3d6\r\n\r\n4\t\t\t4d6\r\n\r\n5\t\t\t5d6\r\n\r\n6-7\t\t6d6\r\n\r\n8-10\t\t7d6\r\n\r\n11-14\t\t8d6\r\n\r\n15-19\t\t9d6\r\n\r\n20-25\t\t10d6\r\n\r\n26-32\t\t11d6\r\n\r\n33-40\t\t12d6\r\n\r\n## Starting Grade\r\n\r\nA typical character begins at grade 5, which includes an origin and four career grades. However, the GM may wish to start the game at a different grade.\r\n\r\nStarting characters at grade 1 will be young, with only an origin. They will be below average in terms of competency, but have limitless scope to grow. Alternatively, starting at grade 2 can give characters an origin and the start of a career. A new cadet or a teenaged moisture farmer longing for adventure might fit this approach.\r\n\r\nA character’s maximum dice pool cannot be reduced to lower than 3d6, no matter how low their grade, though an NPC’s or monster’s dice pool can. A grade 4 character has a maximum dice pool of 4d6, and a grade 3 or lower character has a maximum dice pool of 3d6.\r\n\r\nStarting characters at grade 10 will be highly competent, experienced professionals. These characters know what they’re doing, and they’re good at it. They’ve likely already maxed out one entire career – perhaps they could be ex-military\r\n\r\nor reformed criminals. A grade 10 character has a maximum dice pool of 7d6.\r\n\r\nThe GM can set any starting grade. You may find you enjoy certain styles of game over others, and the starting grade can be a major factor in this. It is recommended, however, that all players begin with characters of the same grade so that none overshadow the others.",

Like all elves, Agathe has the Fey creature type.\r\n- Commanding. Agathe can spend two actions to give another creature who can hear her a free action.\r\n- Magic sense. As an elf, Agathe can sense the presence of magic within 10' of her, although she cannot determine its exact location.\r\n- Meditation. Elves do not need to sleep.  Sometimes they choose to meditate instead, but this is not required.\r\n- Naturally magic. Grand Elves are naturally magical and gain one free magical secret; Agathe knows the secret of light.\r\n- Cultural weapon. Agathe gained a free musket.\r\n- Silver spoon. Born a noble, Agathe gained a bonus 1,000gc and a superior set of clothing.\r\n- Dress wounds.  Agathe can use her healing kit to restore 2d6 HEALTH to a creature she can touch. This takes two actions.  No creature can benefit from this healing more than once per day.\r\n- Cloak flourish. Agathe can deflect blows with a swirl of her cloak. Agathe is always considered to be using a small shield, even when she has no spare hands.\r\n- Musket charge. Agathe can fire a musket shot, move her SPEED, and then attack with her rapier all with one action. She can only do this once per turn.\r\n- Whites of their eyes. When she is charged by another creature, Agathe gets a free musket shot at them as a free action when they come within 10'. She must be wielding her musket to do this.\r\n- Aim. Agathe can spend an action aiming, which gives her +1d6 to a ranged attack taken immediately afterwards in the same turn.\r\n- Quickdraw. Agathe is always considered to be wielding her musket.\r\n\r\nReport abuse\r\n\r\nGoogle Sites\r\n\r\nReport abuse",

The skill list is open-ended. This means that ANYTHING can be a skill; it doesn't have to be on the list below. You might wish to choose flower arranging, origami, or interior decorating. The list below is simply a list of examples; feel free to add to it. Different skills may be appropriate in different settings.  A medieval fantasy setting would not feature computers, for example.\r\n\r\nA skill is not required to attempt a task. Having ranks in a skill indicates that you have particular training in that subject; however, even if you have no ranks in piloting, you can still try to land a damaged shuttlecraft, and having no ranks in pistols does not prevent you from taking a shot at an attacking alien.\r\n\r\n## Academic Skills\r\n\r\nliterature, accounting, law, history, linguistics, art, theology, philosophy, politics, economics, geography, journalism\r\n\r\n## Artistic Skills\r\n\r\npainting, sculpting, calligraphy, pottery, poetry, literature, film-making, photography, printmaking, modelling\r\n\r\n## Combat Skills\r\n\r\ntactics, reactions, unarmed fighting\\*, pistols, rifles, bows, heavy weapons, melee weapon\\*, light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, powered armor, shields\r\n\r\n## Crafting Skills\r\n\r\nappraisal, carpentry, cooking, blacksmith, basket-weaving, stone-masonry, armorer, weaponsmith\r\n\r\n## Personal Skills\r\n\r\nperception, insight, concentration, meditation, bravery, resistance, hardy\r\n\r\n## Gaming Skills\r\n\r\nchess, checkers, dominoes, draughts, poker, blackjack, backgammon, pool, darts\r\n\r\n## Lore Skills\r\n\r\nherbalism, alchemy, nature, religion, heraldry, accounting, law, history, local knowledge, bureaucracy\r\n\r\n## Magical Skills\r\n\r\ninfliction, evocation, movement, compulsion, illusion, infusion, summoning, enchantment, hexes, transformation, creation, abjuration, displacement, divination, healing\r\n\r\n## Hobby Skills\r\n\r\nbrewing, fishing, gardening, hunting, riddles, sewing, ornithology\r\n\r\n## Physical Skills\r\n\r\nclimbing, swimming, jumping, carrying, running, acrobatics, zero-g, throwing\r\n\r\n## Performance Skills\r\n\r\nacting, singing, musical instrument, dancing, mime, magic, storytelling, comedy, fortune-telling, juggling, ventriloquism\r\n\r\n## Psionic Skills\r\n\r\nbiopsionics, clairsentience, clairvoyance, ergokinesis, metapsionics, telekinesis, telepathy, teleportation\r\n\r\n## Scientific Skills\r\n\r\nphysics, astronomy, chemistry, ecology, oceanography, geology, meteorology, biology, zoology, botany, mathematics, archaeology, criminology, economics, psychology, sociology, medicine, genetics, nanotechnology, xenology, climatology\r\n\r\n## Sporting Skills\r\n\r\nfootball, tennis, volleyball, cricket, baseball, basketball, rugby, bowling, dodgeball, badminton, squash, table tennis, sailing, jousting\r\n\r\n## Subterfuge Skills\r\n\r\ncryptology, appraisal, disguise, stealth, thievery, escape artist, bribery, forgery, interrogation\r\n\r\n## Social Skills\r\n\r\nintimidate, flirtation, carousing, negotiating, bluffing, leadership, linguistics, hypnotism\r\n\r\n## Technical Skills\r\n\r\ncomputers, engineering, demolitions, electronic, robotics\r\n\r\n## Trivia Skills\r\n\r\nmovies, rock 'n roll, historical period, celebrities, astrology, theater\r\n\r\n## Vehicle Skills\r\n\r\npiloting, riding, driving, sailing, gunnery, navigation, astrogation\r\n\r\n## Outdoor Skills\r\n\r\nsurvival, animal handling, tracking, farming, mining, dungeoneering, fishing, hunting, nature\r\n\r\n## Other Skills\r\n\r\nbureaucracy, accounting, law, history, local knowledge\r\n\r\nSometimes entire categories of skills are referred to instead of single skills. When this happens, the category is noted in square brackets in order to avoid confusion. For example, an entry which says [outdoor] refers to the entire list of survival, animal handling, tracking, farming, mining, and any others.\r\n\r\nWhen noting a skill, you do not need to indicate categories or placeholder titles. You simply note “chess” rather than “gaming (chess)”; similarly, you simply note “pistols” or “nunchukus” rather than “ranged weapon (pistols)” or “melee weapon (nunchaku)”.\r\n\r\n- Weapons. In combat, unarmed fighting, and weapon skills all add to relevant AGI, INT, or STR attack checks. Melee weapons include categories of weapon type (swords, axes, clubs, knives,etc.); ranged weapons similarly include weapon types, such as bows, pistols, rifles, or heavy weapons. Gunnery refers to vehicle or ship-mounted weapons. Unarmed combat types include (but are not limited to) boxing, wrestling, brawling, andmartial arts.\r\n- Armor. Armor is divided into light, medium, heavy, and powered armor.  Each is a separate skill. Note that armor, like any other equipment, provides quality benefits only as far as the wearer's skill allows (see dice pools).\r\n\r\n### Other Skills\r\n\r\n- Computers includes use of scanners and starship sensor/comms systems.\r\n- Local knowledge is a catch-all term; the skill should actually be the name of a place.\r\n- Navigation refers to land-based travel. The space-based equivalent is astrogation.\r\n\r\n## What Skill Levels Mean\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, 1 skill rank is proficient, 3 is considered skilled, and is roughly equal to a bachelor’s degree; 6 is an expert, and is roughly equal to a doctorate; 10 is regarded as mastery; and 15 makes you an authority on that subject. These ranks correspond to derived dice pools of 1d6, 2d6, 3d6, 4d6, and 5d6.\r\n\r\nEinstein had a score of 15 (5d6) in physics. Miyamoto Musashi had a score of 15 (5d6) in swords. Characters with skills that high are extremely rare.\r\n\r\nSkill Ranks \tSkill Level \tDice Pool\r\n\r\n1 \t\t\t\tProficient \t\t1d6\r\n\r\n3 \t\t\t\tSkilled \t\t2d6\r\n\r\n6 \t\t\t\tExpert \t\t3d6\r\n\r\n10 \t\t\t\tMastery \t\t4d6\r\n\r\n15 \t\t\t\tAuthority \t\t5d6",

          "Markdown": "# Traits\r\n\r\nA character’s trait is a dominant characteristic based on his attributes. It provides an ability or quality related to either his highest or lowest attribute. Traits include things like rugged, massive, alcoholic, inspiring, and so on. If someone were to describe your character, this is the first word they’d use—“Ben? You mean that suave spy?”\r\n\r\nChoose either your highest or lowest attribute (both will give you an advantage; choosing the lowest doesn’t give you a disadvantage—for example, a low WIL allows you to choose “alcoholic,” which gives you a bonus SOAK score when intoxicated). Choose a corresponding trait (or roll for it if you prefer a little randomness).\r\n\r\nYour trait forms part of your descriptor and should be noted on your character sheet. For example:\r\n\r\n## Duke Roosevelt is an aging rugged Human bounty hunter who loves 50s music\r\n\r\n## High Attributes\r\n\r\n### STRENGTH\r\n\r\n- **Athletic.**Brawny and strong, you are able to plough through difficult terrain. Difficult terrain does not reduce your speed.\r\n- **Brawny.**You gain a +40 lb. carrying capacity.\r\n- **Massive.**You are enormous and solid. You are immune to knockdown and knockback effects by anything of your size category or smaller.\r\n- **Mighty.**You do +1d6 unarmed damage.\r\n\r\n### AGILITY\r\n\r\n- **Ambidextrous.**You do not suffer the usual –2d6 penalty to attacks made while dual-wielding a double weapon or a secondary offhand weapon.\r\n- **Deadeye.**Once per day you automatically hit with a ranged shot within two range increments as long as you do not exchange any attack dice for damage dice or combine it with another exploit.\r\n- **Nimble.** You gain a CLIMB speed equal to your regular SPEED.\r\n- **Quick.** You gain +1d6 INITIATIVE..\r\n\r\n### ENDURANCE\r\n\r\n- **Rugged.**You are tough and shrug off hardships. Once per day you can spend two actions (a full turn) to recover to half your normal maximum HEALTH.\r\n- **Tough as Nails.** You gain a +2 SOAK bonus which stacks with any other SOAK scores you may have.\r\n- **Healthy.**You never seem to get a cold. You are immune to normal diseases.\r\n- **Tireless.** You are immune to the Fatigued condition.\r\n\r\n### INTUITION\r\n\r\n- **Alert.** Constantly aware of your surroundings, you gain +1d6 to INT perception checks, and you always win INITIATIVE ties.\r\n- **Empathic.** You easily understand how others feel. Once per day you can attempt to adjust another’s mood with a CHA vs. MENTAL DEFENSE attack. If you succeed, you can give them either the Manic or Angry condition. You must be able to converse with your target to do this.\r\n- **Insightful.** You can always tell when somebody is verbally lying to you, although this does not give you any further information.\r\n- **Observant.** You know where your enemies are during combat. You cannot be flanked.\r\n\r\n### LOGIC\r\n\r\n- **Brilliant.**You mind is honed, sharp, and analytical. Once per day you may replace any other attribute check with a LOG check.\r\n- **Erudite.**You remember a vast catalog of knowledge. At any time you may make a LOG check in place of any CHA check to interact with them by recalling trivia of interest to your target, though only once per target.\r\n- **Deductive.**You are a master of reason and logic. Once per day you can ask the GM a yes/no question, and it will be answered truthfully.\r\n- **Learned.**You can communicate in any language.\r\n\r\n### WILLPOWER\r\n\r\n- **Stoic.**You are able to hide pain and discomfort. Once per day, when you would normally be reduced to zero HEALTH, you are reduced to 1 HEALTH instead.\r\n- **Unflappable.**You are not easily distracted or surprised. The Feint exploit does not work on you.\r\n- **Brave.**You are immune to the Afraid condition.\r\n- **Stubborn.** You are immne to the Charmed condition.\r\n\r\n### CHARISMA\r\n\r\n- **Commanding.**You have presence, and people listen to you. By spending an action you can give an ally within earshot a single bonus action whihc they can take immediately.\r\n- **Inspiring.**You are able to instill positive emotions in people with your words, using an action to give them a +1d6 bonus to their next attribute check if they are within 30' of you.\r\n- **Persuasive.**You are adept at negotiating with others. When you purchase anything under $1,000 in value, you are able to reduce the final price you pay for the item by 3d6 percent.\r\n- **Suave.** Once per day a CHA vs. MENTAL DEFENSE attack can be used to give a target the Charmed condition.\r\n\r\n### REPUTATION\r\n\r\n- **Affluent.** You are well-off, and your clothing and gear reflect that. Choose one item. That item gains one quality level. You can switch this benefit to a different item, but that takes 24 hours.\r\n- **Egotistical.**You have a very high opinion of yourself, which manifests itself as extreme confidence and  surety. You gain a +4 MENTAL DEFENSE bonus. Unfortunately, you sometimes ask “don’t you know who I am?”\r\n- **Posh.** You are at home in high society.  When dealing with somebody with a REP score lower than your own, you get +1d6 to social checks.\r\n- **Well-known.** You are famous; people recognize you, for good or ill. You have learned to use this reputation. Once per day you may substitute your REP attribute for another attribute in order to make an attribute check.\r\n\r\n## Low Attributes\r\n\r\n### STRENGTH\r\n\r\n- **Feeble.** You are physically weak and frail, which taught you the value of brains over brawn. Once per day you may use a LOG check in place of a STR check and accomplish your goal through cunning and ingenuity.\r\n- **Tottering.** You find it a struggle to stand and require the use of a wheelchair which gives you a +1 SPEED bonus on normal terrain.\r\n- **Delicate.** You are slight of build, and break easily. As such, you have learned to compensate, and gain +1 to RANGED and MELEE DEFENSE.\r\n\r\n### AGILITY\r\n\r\n- **Clumsy.** You often stumble or drop items. You are so used to falling that you take less damage than most from a fall. Reduce the height fallen by 10' when calculating falling damage.\r\n- **Lame.**You have a limp, and move slowly, possibly with a cane. This causes people to underestimate you, granting you a +1d6 bonus to INITIATIVE checks.\r\n- **Slow**. You are slow. However, this has its benefits as you are less likely to make mistakes. Once per day you may reroll am attribute check which you have failed.\r\n\r\n### ENDURANCE\r\n\r\n- **Sickly.** Your poor health often prevents you from undertaking extended physical exertion. However, you have developed coping strategies which enable you to recover quickly. Once per day you may gather your strength and determinedly recover 1d6 HEALTH.\r\n- **Coughing.**Your constant coughing elicits sympathy from onlookers who are hesitant to attack an obviously ill person. You gain a +4 DEFENSE bonus against anyone you have not yet attacked.\r\n\r\n### INTUITION\r\n\r\n- **Distracted.**Your attention is always somewhere else and can be a cause of frustration for others. However, the right non sequitur can sometimes prove useful: once per day, as an ally is making an attribute check, you can make a completely random comment which jogs their memory and grants them a +2d6 bonus to the check.\r\n- **Naive.**Naivete can be an endearing trait in some; it can also act as an insulation. Once per day you may completely ignore a fear-based effect or condition.\r\n\r\n### LOGIC\r\n\r\n- **Forgetful.** You constantly forget and misplace things; often they are still about your person. Once per day you may produce an item you didn’t know you were carrying. The item can be any type of item, and can be worth up to the result of your LUC check.\r\n- **Illiterate.**You cannot read. Instead, you have learned to memorize common words which you need to recognize often. You have a fantastic memory and can automatically recall information you have been exposed to.\r\n\r\n### WILLPOWER\r\n\r\n- **Alcoholic.**You are usually drunk. While this can impair your judgment, it also enables you to shrug off injury. You gain +2 SOAK.\r\n- **Reckless.** Your poor judgment often lands you in trouble, but it leads to a certain confidence. If you completely ignore cover, you gain a +1d6 attack bonus as long as you are not using a shield.\r\n- **Spendthrift.**You lack self-discipline and spend your money on trivialities. This can have its advantages, however; once per day you can pull an item from your pocket that you forgot you’d bought, retroactively spending the value of your LUC check in dollars.\r\n\r\n### CHARISMA\r\n\r\n- **Disfigured.**Your appearance is memorable. However, it serves to instill fear when you need it to. You gain an additional 1d6 bonus to intimidation attempts.\r\n- **Obnoxious.** Your personality really repels people. You are an expert at insults, and can use an action to make a LOG vs. WIL check to enrage and distract others, causing them to gain the Angry condition.\r\n- **Unwashed.**Your unkempt appearance causes others to overlook you. You can hide in plain sight using INT in place of AGI.\r\n\r\n### REPUTATION\r\n\r\n- **Impoverished.**You have little in the way of worldy goods. Even your clothes are old and worn. You know how to make the most of things, however, and how to take care of your property. Choose one item. That item gains one quality level. You can switch this benefit to a different item, but that takes 24 hours.\r\n- **Nondescript.** You’re the type of person nobody remembers. Even after you have met someone, you can meet them again and they will not recognize you if you choose to act in a nondescript manner. You can only do this the second time you meet somebody; from the third time onwards, you are recognized as normal.",

          "Markdown": "# Universal Exploits\r\n\r\n**180 hammerhead (requires piloting skill; AGI 8+).**A starship is rotated 180 degrees while continuing its momentum, enabling it to face and fire at pursuers. The ship continues moving in the same direction it was moving initially, and cannot turn until this maneuver is performed again to correct its facing.\r\n\r\n**Achilles heel (requires LOG 5+; aim; any [scientific] skill).** Identifying a weakness in your target, you pay 2d6 and bypass its SOAK score. This exploit can only be performed once per target. Alternatively, you may grant this bonus to one ally who must use it within one round.\r\n\r\n**Aim.** This is identical to the Feint exploit, but for ranged combat; it grants +1d6 bonus to an attack roll taken in the same turn. The attack action must come immediately after the aiming action. All characters get either the Aim, Focus, or Feint exploit for free.\r\n\r\n**Always prepared (requires LOG 8+).**You have a brilliant tactical mind, and are always prepared. You may declare a single action which you took prior to the encounter (even if you didn't know the encounter was going to take place) which helps you in this exact scenario. This must be an action you were capable of.\r\n\r\n**Analytics (requires LOG 6+).** Studying your target's behaviour, you notice a pattern to its actions. You grant all allies within 30' a +1d6 bonus to attack the target until the start of your next turn. This costs one action.\r\n\r\n**Arcane recharge (requires meditation skill).**You can spend five minutes to recover 2d6 Magic Points once per day.\r\n\r\n**Arcane secret (requires LOG 4+).** You have learned or discovered an arcane secret - either an element, creature type, or virtue. You can take this exploit multiple times, learning a new secret each time, but you may know no more secrets than your LOG attribute.\r\n\r\n**Arm lock (requires AGI 8+, martial arts skill).** When you successfully grab a foe, you place your target in a painful armlock. The target gains the Restrained condition, drops any items in that hand, and cannot use that arm until he escapes. You may move at half SPEED, taking your victim with you. If you apply this twice, the attacker gains the severe Restrained condition.\r\n\r\n**Attune Implement.** A magical implement you own (wand, staff, holy symbol, orb) gains one level of quality when you use it to cast spells.\r\n\r\n**Bearhug (requires STR 8+).** When you successfully grab a foe, you grab your target with both arms, squeezing him. You can only bearhug a target of your size category or smaller. The target gains the Restrained condition, and takes 1d6 damage at the start of each of his turns. You may move at half SPEED, taking your victim with you.\r\n\r\n**Blindfighter.**Skilled at using senses other than sight for combat, you may ignore darkness and the Blind condition for melee combat.\r\n\r\n**Blinding attack (requires AGI 6+).** You throw sand into your opponent’s eyes, cover him in a cloak, pull his helm down, or gash his forehead; on a successful hit your target gains the Blind condition.\r\n\r\n**Blind shot (requires LUC 5+).**While in full cover, you may pay 2d6 to take a shot without looking at what you are shooting at or exposing yourself. You use your LUC attribute instead of your AGI or INT for this shot.\r\n\r\n**Brush off (requires STR 8+).** You contemptuously brush aside some melee attacks. Once per turn you may remove one die of damage from a successful melee attack against you, as long as the attacker is your size or smaller.\r\n\r\n**Burst of speed (requires piloting or driving skill).** Your mount, ship, or vehicle gains a speed boost of 2 hexes/squares for the turn.\r\n\r\n**Burnout (requires driving skill).** You launch your vehicle forward from a stationary position at maximum acceleration, gaining double acceleration in the first round only.\r\n\r\n**Charge.** Move your speed in a straight line and then attack at the end of it and pay 2d6. You gain +1d6 damage to your attack. You must move at least 10'.\r\n\r\n**Cleave (requires STR 8+)**. When using STR as your attack attribute, you follow through in one mighty swing, and make an additional attack at -1d6 against an adjacent foe if the first one hits.\r\n\r\n**Counterhack.**When an opponent is attempting to access your systems using the System Override exploit, you may make an immediate opposed LOG check to block the attempt.\r\n\r\n**Crippling strike (requires AGI 5+; deadly strike).** You expertly target your opponent’s legs, causing a wound which inflicts the Slowed condition upon him.\r\n\r\n**Dart In (requires Charge)**. You move your SPEED, make a melee attack at –1d6, and then move your SPEED back again to your starting position. You cannot combine this exploit with other exploits, not can you dart in while on difficult terrain.\r\n\r\n**Deadly strike (requires AGI or STR 5+).** You inflict an additional 1d6 damage with a successful hit. For a ranged attack, this is likely a headshot. By default, any character can trade attack dice to increase damage on a 2:1 basis.\r\n\r\n**Death from on high (requires charge).** You pay 2d6 and drop down on your opponent from at least 5' above him. This counts as a charge but knocks your opponent prone and does 2d6 extra damage instead of 1d6.\r\n\r\n**Die hard (requires WIL 8+).**While at negative HEALTH you are still conscious, and can take one action per round. You still form the death countdown pool as normal. If you take any further damage, you fall unconscious as normal.\r\n\r\n**Dive for cover (requires AGI 7+).** If a ranged attack misses you, you may immediately move half your speed and either throw yourself prone or get behind cover if it is in range. This is a free reaction.\r\n\r\n**Dodge (requires AGI 6+).** You may use a reaction to dodge one attack you are aware of, as long as you are not in cover. State your intention before the attack roll. The attacker suffers a -2d6 penalty for that attack.\r\n\r\n**Double tap (requires AGI 7+; aim).** You fire two quick shots at your target at the cost of just one action, paying 2d6.\r\n\r\n**Dual Defense (requires AGI 8+).**When dual-wielding, you can use both weapons defensively; you count as wielding a large shield until your next turn, but you cannot attack until your next turn.\r\n\r\n**Draw a bead (requires INT 5+).**The penalty for firing at a target engaged in melee is reduced from 2d6 to 1d6.\r\n\r\n**e-Defender.**Your starship gains +4 e- DEFENSE. This does not stack with additional e-Defenders.\r\n\r\n**Evasive action (requires AGI 5+; piloting skill).**You use your action to perform a series of evasive maneuvers which grant your ship +4 DEFENSE until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\n**Expert Disarm (requires AGI 6).**When you use a Called Shot to disarm a target, you do not have to pay the 2d6.\r\n\r\n**Extreme concentration (requires WIL 8+; concentration skill).**You can maintain concentration on two simultaneous spells. Each requires an action to maintain (thus requiring a whole turn to maintain both).\r\n\r\n**Far Shot**. You increase range increments by 50%.\r\n\r\n**Feint.**This is identical to the Aim exploit, but for melee combat; it grants +1d6 bonus to an attack roll taken in the same turn. The attack action must come immediately after the feinting action. All characters get either the Focus, Aim or Feint exploit for free.\r\n\r\n**Fleet.**You are faster than you look. You gain +2 SPEED beyond that granted by your STR and AGI attributes. This does not stack with other SPEED bonuses.\r\n\r\n**Flying kick (requires AGI 8+; martial arts skill).**You move your speed and issue a flying kick at the end of it, dealing your martial arts damage with a bonus 1d6 damage.\r\n\r\n**Focus.** If you spend one action focusing, you gain +1d6 to a spell cast in the same round. Like Aim and Feint, this exploit is available to starting characters.\r\n\r\n**Fortitude.**You gain a permanent +2 MELEE DEFENSE, able to shrug off many attacks.\r\n\r\n**High energy turn (requires piloting skill; INT 8+).**The pilot uses FTL energy to force a ship into any emergency facing. It requires an AGI check equal to 10 + the ship's class.  Failure infliucts 1d6 damage to the ship's SS per ship class. Success allows the pilot to face the ship in any direction he wishes.\r\n\r\n**Hunker down (requires END 6+).** Cover grants you one extra die of cover.\r\n\r\n**Improviser.** You are adept at using bar stools and other items as weapons. You suffer no attack penalties for improvised melee weapons.\r\n\r\n**Iron Will.** You gain a permanent +2 to MENTAL DEFENSE, able to shrug off many mental attacks.\r\n\r\n**J-turn (requires driving skill; AGI 6+).**Otherwise known as the \"moonshiner's turn\", you reverse and spin your vehicle 180-degrees.  Also known as a \"Rockford\", this exploit allows you to drive a vehicle forward as normal from any facing.\r\n\r\n**Jury-rig (requires LOG 6+; engineering skill).** You modify a weapon (yours or an adjacent ally's) to either increase its range by 50% or its damage by +1d6 until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\n**Knockback (requires knockdown).** When you use a Called Shot to move a target, you do not have to pay the 2d6; however, for each 1d6 you choose to pay, the target is pushed one extra square.\r\n\r\n**Knockdown (requires STR 5+).**When you use a Called Shot to knock a target prone, you do not have to pay the 2d6; additionally, the target gains the Downed condition (making it unable to stand until that condition has been shaken off).\r\n\r\n**Leadership (requires CHA 8+).**You are able to donate one or more of your available LUC dice to another character as a free reaction to their attempting an attribute check. You must declare this before they roll the dice.\r\n\r\n**Leaping Attack (requires AGI 8+, Charge).**You leap into the air as you make a melee attack. You gain +1d6 damage, but if you miss your opponent gets a free attack.\r\n\r\n**Lightning Reflexes.** You gain a permanent +2 to RANGED DEFENSE, able to dodge many ranged attacks.\r\n\r\n**Lucky Escape (requires LUC 6+).** You may avoid all damage from one attack as a free reaction. You can only do this once per day.\r\n\r\n**Lunge.**You increase your reach by 5' for one attack at a cost of –1d6.\r\n\r\n**Mighty Sunder (requires Sunder).** Half the damage from your sunder also applies to the target weapon’s wielder.\r\n\r\n**Opportunist stomp.** You can stomp on an adjacent prone opponent as a free action. This is an unarmed attack and uses your natural damage value.\r\n\r\n**Opportunity Strike.** You can make an attack as a free action attack against a foe who disengages from melee combat with you.\r\n\r\n**Organization member.** You are a member of a specific organization, and gain all the benefits that membership grants. You do not recover this exploit should you leave the organization or should it cease to exist.\r\n\r\n**Pep talk (requires CHA 6+).** You can spend your ambush turn (if you have access to it) giving your allies a pep talk. They all gain a +1d6 bonus to initiative in the ensuing combat.\r\n\r\n**Piledriver (requires STR 8+, wrestling skill).** You grab your opponent, lift him, and then drop to the ground, driving his head into the ground. Both you and your opponent end up prone. The exploit costs 2d6 and, if successful, the target takes double damage and gains the Dazed condition.\r\n\r\n**Point-Blank Shot.**You get +1d6 to hit ranged targets within 10'. This does not stack with the +1d6 from using a sidearm against an adjacent foe.\r\n\r\n**Predictive reflexes (requires INT 6+).**You are good at reading the situation. You gain a permanent +1d6 bonus to your INITIATIVE checks.\r\n\r\n**Protector (requires END 5+).** You can take an attack meant for an adjacent ally. If the attack hits your ally, you take the damage instead. If you have a shield, the ally also benefits from your shield's defense bonus.\r\n\r\n**Quickstand (requires AGI 6+, martial arts skill).** Once per turn you can stand immediately from prone as a free action or reaction and you are immune to the Downed condition.\r\n\r\n**Quickdraw (requires AGI 6+).** If you are disarmed, you may immediately draw another weapon as an immediate reaction as long as you have one available.\r\n\r\n**Quick Mount (requires riding skill).**You can mount or dismount a horse or other mount as a free action. Otherwise, this would cost an action.\r\n\r\n**Quickstep.** You can move 5’ as a free action.\r\n\r\n**Reckless act.**In utter disregard for your own safety, you make yourself a target as you unleash your attacks. You gain +1d6 to ranged attacks as long as you are not concealed, in cover, or using a shield. If you use Dodge, or any other exploit which protects you, you lose this bonus for one minute.\r\n\r\n**Reinforce shield (requires LOG 6+; computer operation skill).**Until the start of your next turn, one shield (forward, aft, port, or starboard) becomes reinforced. It gains a +2 SOAK.\r\n\r\n**Relativity corkscrew (requires piloting skill; physics skill; LOG 10+).** This complex maneuver uses FTL speeds, time dilation, and high-level calculations to gain a temporal advantage in starship combat. An FTL drive is necessary. One action is used to perform the relativity corkscrew, but the ship gains three actions in return.  However, this is a dangerous maneuver and requires a Strenuous [25] LOG check to accomplish. It cannot be performed again until at least one hour has been spent maintaining the FTL engines.\r\n\r\n**Ricochet (requires INT 8+; aim).** You can pay 4d6 to “bounce” a ranged attack off of one surface in order to hit a target to whom you would not normally have line of sight. This does not negate the target's cover bonuses; it merely creates a line of sight to a target where there previously was none.\r\n\r\n**Roll with it (requires AGI 5+).** By voluntarily falling prone, you reduce damage by 2d6. You cannot use any instant-stand exploits in combination with this exploit.\r\n\r\n**Scattershot.**When using a shotgun, you can attack two adjacent targets within 15' of you with a single attack action.\r\n\r\n**Sidestep (requires AGI 8+).**When charged by an attacker, you casually step aside, causing him to rush past you. If the attacker's attack misses, he continues onwards in a straight line to the extent of his movement, unless something blocks his way. If he collides with a solid object, he takes 1d6 blunt damage.\r\n\r\n**Signature Spell (requires LOG 6+).**Using the magic rules, devise and name a spell from the skills and secrets that you know. This spell becomes a signature spell.  You may take this exploit multiple times, adding a new signature spell each time, but you may not have more signature spells than the value of your LOG attribute. A signature spell takes only one action to cast (rather than the usual two actions), although only one may be cast per round. Additionally, you gain a +1d6 die bonus to to attribute checks or attacks with it.\r\n\r\n**Ski (requires driving skill; AGI 8+).**You drive a four-wheeled vehicle on two of its side wheels. This allows you to pass through narrow gaps, and increases your DEFENSE from the rear or front by +4.  You can ski for one round, returning to all four wheels at the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\n**Spinning kick (requires AGI 8+, martial arts skill).** A quick turn and your foot lashes out to strike your opponent. This attack is a free action. You do your normal unarmed damage; you may not stack this kick with additional exploits..\r\n\r\n**Spray.** When using a weapon with the auto trait you may spend all your actions to spray a 30’ cone, making one attack against every target not in cover within the cone. Make one attack roll and apply it to the RANGED DEFENSE of all within that area.\r\n\r\n**Strafe.** When using a weapon with the auto trait you may, as a single action, spray an area 15’ x 15’ with fire. Everyone in that area takes 1d6 damage of the appropriate type, and cannot SOAK that damage. This is the only attack you can make with this weapon this turn.\r\n\r\n**Sunder.**You target your opponent’s weapon or shield with the intention of breaking it. The weapon has same MELEE DEFENSE as its wielder; you take –2d6 to strike a weapon and no penalty to strike a shield.\r\n\r\n**Stop Right There!**Enemies which try to move past you (move within your reach) are subject to a free action attack, which stops their movement if successful.\r\n\r\n**System override.** You remotely access another ship's control computer, and briefly take a system offline with a LOG vs. E-DEFENSE attack.  One shield facing, or one weapon, can be deactivated until the beginning of the target ship's next turn, at which point it is automatically reactivated.\r\n\r\n**Systems upgrade (requires Android).**  Choose one modification from the Android modification exploits list. You may repeat this exploit.\r\n\r\n**Target engines (requires gunnery skill).** You can choose to target an enemy ship's engines by paying 2d6. Attacks to the engines directly reduce their power output instead of damaging superstructure (and consequently affecting the ship's speed or FTL capability).\r\n\r\n**Taunt (requires CHA 8+).** You taunt your target, enraging it, and make a CHA vs. MENTAL DEFENSE attack. If successful, the target focuses all its attacks on you until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\n**Throw (requires STR or AGI 7+; trip or knockdown).** When you use a Called Shot to knock a target prone, you also move the target two squares and do your unarmed damage.STR is the prerequisite if the qualifying exploit is Knockdown; AGI if it is Trip.\r\n\r\n**Throw Anything.** You suffer no attack penalty for improvised ranged weapons (including throwing melee weapons, which count as improvised when used in this way).\r\n\r\n**Torpedo spread (requires gunnery skill).** Multiple torpedoes can be fired in a spread which affects a wide area of effect.  For each 1d6 paid, one hex within range is affected; all affected hexes automatically do 1d6 damage of the appropriate type to any vessels in them.\r\n\r\n**Trip (requires AGI 6+).**When you use a Called Shot to knock a target prone, you do not have to pay the 2d6; additionally, the target gains the Downed condition (making it unable to stand until that condition has been shaken off). You still do your normal attack damage. Additionally, if you are a smaller size category than your target, you gain +1d6 to your attack.\r\n\r\n**Utilikit (requires LOG 7+; engineering skill).** You are able to turn one device into another device of equal value or lower. For example, you can modulate your scanner to use as a phaser, or enable your laser knife to operate as a lock pick. The device only functions in this way for a single action before becoming permanently useless. It takes 10 minutes to make the change.\r\n\r\n**Warp maneuver (requires LOG 8+; engineering skill, piloting skill).** A very dangerous maneuver, you use your ship's FTL capability to reposition your ship on the battlemap. You can move to any location to which you have direct line-of-sight, but your resultant facing is randomized (roll 1d6). This takes your ship's FTL engines offline, and they require an hour to repair.\r\n\r\n**Whirlwind frenzy (requires AGI 6+).** You attack all adjacent targets, but only do 1d6 damage to each.  You must still make an attack roll against each target. Any targets you hit are pushed back 5', clearing a space around you.\r\n\r\n**Wingover (requires AGI 5+; piloting skill).** You can reverse direction 180-degrees instantly with a half-loop plus barrel roll. The starship you are piloting must be Class V or smaller. This maneuver is part of the move phase. To perform the maneuver, the pilot must make an AGI (piloting) check with a dif culty of 10 + the ship's current speed. If successful, the maneuver is performed and the ship takes 1 SS damage; if unsuccessful, the maneuver is not performed, and the ship takes 1d6 SS damage (although this cannot reduce it to below 1 SS).",

It is an optional system for imbuing martial artists with pseudo-magical abilities.\r\n\r\nShaolin monks and bushido samurai are masters of chi (though the latter might call it ki), but they are certainly not the only users of this mystical energy and not all characters will completely understand what it is.

Chi allows you to do seemingly magical things: walk on water, levitate, withstand extreme punishment, heal wounds, and so on. Be it heart, ki, aligned chakras, a reservoir of rage, the eye of the tiger, or simply holding one’s focus in times of stress, Chi often plays a critical role in the action genre.\r\n\r\n## CHI Attribute\r\n\r\nYou may use your Chi attribute in place of another attribute whenever you are using your martial arts skill to make an attribute check. This will usually be an attack roll. Note that some martial arts also allow you to use your martial arts skill with certain weapons.\r\n\r\n## Chi Points\r\n\r\nCharacters have a number of Chi points equal to their CHI dice pool (so a character with a 3d6 Chi dice pool has 3 Chi points). Adopting stances depletes this store. Once per day, characters can meditate (or imbibe alcohol, or rock out to their favorite tunes, or some other task that puts them in the right frame of mind) for five minutes to regain all their Chi points.\r\n\r\n## Stances\r\n\r\nUsing Chi involves taking a stance. Stances represent different manifestations of your character’s inner power—for example, the mountain stance (H. in) allows a martial artist to perform incredible feats of strength, while the lightning stance (Phanyu) is associated with preternaturally fast movement. A stance might not always be a physical posture; sometimes it may a mental attitude.\r\n\r\nMechanically, a stance is an exploit. Each stance grants you a number of benefits. Adopting a stance is a free action, costs 1 Chi point, and lasts until the start of your next turn. You may only adopt one stance at a time.\r\n\r\nIn total, you may learn a number of stances equal to your CHI dice pool; in other words, if your CHI attribute is 10 (4d6) you may learn up to four stances.\r\n\r\n## Hin (Mountain) Stance\r\n\r\nThe strength of your Chi manifests in an incredible sense of balance and resilience for physical stress. You are as indomitable as a mountain, able to bear incredible weight, make parts of your body invulnerable, and strike with so great a focus and force that nearly any object will shatter under your blows. Your opponents learn that you are wellsuited to suffer a flurry of strikes, and to fear the power of your own.\r\n\r\n- You may use your CHI attribute in place of your STR attribute for the purpose of attribute checks.\r\n- You become immobile. No attack roll from a creature your size, one size larger, or smaller than you, can move you.\r\n- You cannot move from your location, although you may act normally in that location.\r\n\r\n## Daichin (Warrior) Stance\r\n\r\nYour soul is that of the warrior, destined to compete, to fight, and to win. When your Chi surges forth it can be incredibly deadly, able to reach preternatural heights of physical awareness that turns you into a legendary combatant. Your opponents quickly become wary of the precision of your blows, your amazing reflexes, and how closely you can bring both body and mind into perfect attunement.\r\n\r\n- You can bring your mind and body into perfect alignment. Increase all three of your Defenses to the highest of these three values.\r\n- You gain +1d6 to all damage rolls.\r\n- You cannot heal or be healed.\r\n\r\n## Weifēng (Wind) Stance\r\n\r\nWhen using your Chi you become lighter, faster, and fleeter than any normal human could ever be, able to move with the silence of a subtle gust of wind, run across water and tree branches, dash with incredible speed, and dodge so quickly as to become a blur. Your opponents are impressed by your reflexes and rattled by how talented you are at dodging their attacks.\r\n\r\n- You may use your CHI attribute in place of your AGI attribute for the purpose of attribute checks.\r\n- You double your Speed.\r\n- You can walk across the surface of any liquid.\r\n- You can ignore a number of attacks equal to your Chi dice pool until the beginning of your next turn as long as you take your full movement during your turn. You must choose to ignore an attack before the attack roll is made.\r\n\r\n## Phanyu (Lightning) Stance\r\n\r\nYour fists and feet are like lightning, and when using Chi you strike your enemies in the blink of an eye with explosive force. Dodging attacks is second nature to you, and your response of battering blows is nearly invisible to the naked eye. Your opponents are brought down quickly by your aggressive flurries, if they even see them coming.\r\n\r\n- You may use your CHI attribute in place of your AGI attribute for the purpose of attribute checks.\r\n- You gain an additional action which can be used to make a melee attack.\r\n- You charge your body and wait to dodge an attack until the very last possible moment, moving so fast that you seem not to move at all. You negate the next attack against you that you are aware of.\r\n- You turn into a veritable whirlwind of deadly fists and feet. You can spend all your actions to make one melee attack against every adjacent opponent.\r\n\r\n## Toka (Stone) Stance\r\n\r\nYou are as enduring as rock and tough to the core, and your Chi manifests by protecting you from harm. Your skin and limbs can harden like stone, and eventually you learn to stand against any force, no matter how great. Your opponents are dumbfounded by your resilience and defeated by your unwillingness to falter against their attacks.\r\n\r\n- You may use your CHI attribute in place of your END attribute for the purpose of attribute checks.\r\n- You make your body remarkably resilient to attack. You gain Soak equal to your CHI attribute.\r\n- You become immune to critical hits.\r\n- You become immune to one energy type, chosen when you enter the stance. Choose from fire/heat, cold, sonic, or electricity.\r\n\r\n## Sūrya (Sun) Stance\r\n\r\nThe essence of your Chi is as pure as sunlight and you can manifest it to be just as nourishing. You are able to heal wounds, alleviate the pains others, and even bring the recently deceased back to life. Enemies are frustrated by your presence on the battlefield and confounded when your allies are restored by your abilities.\r\n\r\n- You glow with inner light; the area 30' around you is as bright as daylight.\r\n- You can heal another creature by touch, restoring Health equal to your CHI attribute with one action.\r\n- You can use all your actions to spread a warmth of energy that mends wounds and heals injuries. You restore Health equal to your CHI to all allies within 30'.\r\n- All allies within the light of your glow (30') gain +4 Mental Defense.\r\n- You gain +1d6 Health at the end of your turn.\r\n\r\n## Umfula (River) Stance\r\n\r\nYour Chi makes you intimately familiar to the energies that flow through all living creatures, and your incredible awareness allows you to bend them to your whim. You are able to sense the Chi of another, align the minds of your allies, and express supreme concentration in the face of attacks that would leave the mind of any other person completely destroyed. Your opponents are disturbed by your cerebral fortitude and undone by their own mental assaults.\r\n\r\n- You may use your CHI attribute in place of your AGI attribute for the purpose of attribute checks.\r\n- You focus your Chi against your attacker, swirling the power they wield against you and gracefully turning it back. When a melee attack misses you, the attacker causes its melee damage to itself.\r\n- If you are knocked prone, you automatically stand again for free.\r\n- You are immune to mental attacks\r\n- You can spend one action to step through the space in between. You briefly cross the backdoors of existence, teleporting up to 30' to a location you can see.\r\n\r\n## Yueliang (Moon) Stance\r\n\r\nYou can physically manifest your Chi with surprising ease, using it to perform feats that defy belief. You are able to wield it as a weapon that harms the souls of other creatures, or gather it for deadly attacks that can level buildings. Your opponents are bewildered and taken aback by your supernatural powers.\r\n\r\n- You double your Jump distances.\r\n- You can wrap your fists in mystical energy to punch your target’s very soul. When you make a melee attack, you target your foe’s Mental Defense instead.\r\n- You can make melee attacks against targets up to 30' away.\r\n- You can levitate to a height in feet up to your CHI attribute.\r\n\r\n## Ma-eum (Mind) Stance\r\n\r\nYour understanding of Chi has revealed the void behind all things, and you have attained some mastery over this oblivion. You are able to hamper the Chi of others, take it away from them, or even negate the use of mystical power nearby. Your opponents are left powerless before you, defeated in the wake of your control over the nothing that is everything.\r\n\r\n- You may use your CHI attribute in place of your INT attribute for the purpose of attribute checks.\r\n- When you successfully attack an enemy, you drain 1 Chi point from them.\r\n- Chi stances within 30' of you cost double the normal number of Chi points.\r\n- You are able to sense the presence of Chi within 100', and the number of Chi points that person has.\r\n\r\n## Gexing (Heart) Stance\r\n\r\nYour control over Chi opens windows to the souls of those you look upon. By utilizing your abilities, you can manipulate the emotions of others, completely conceal your own, and empower others to reach further and fight harder. Your opponents are simultaneously filled with both wonder and great malice when in your presence.\r\n\r\n- You may use your CHI attribute in place of your CHA attribute for the purpose of attribute checks.\r\n- Your deceptions have so much conviction that to all others it is an unquestionable truth. You tell perfect lies. These can be as outlandish as you like and creatures are allowed to disbelieve it, but no power, technology, magic, or check can reveal that you are not speaking the truth.\r\n- You may make a mental attack against a creature within 30'. If successful, it becomes your thrall, gaining the dominated condition. It can shake this condition off as normal.\r\n- You automatically sense lies and deceptions. You do not necessarily learn the truth, but you are aware of untruths.\r\n- You may freely donate your LUC dice to allies within 30' on their turn. They must use the donated dice immediately.",

Made completely of clockwork, their bodies are filled with cogs and gears, and they move with a certain stiffness, their faces stuck in a single expression.\r\n\r\nA technically proficient scavenger race, Clockfolk have the unnerving ability to use their surroundings to repair themselves. Damage a Clockfolk, and it might pick up a nearby knife or fork, spare part, or random trinket and use it to replace a damaged component. They can even use organic “components,” with the result that some look particularly gruesome.\r\n\r\nClockfolk are generally uncomfortable with chaos and disorder. In a hierarchy, they need to know the exact structure and their place within it, and will not deviate from that chain, for good or ill. Even simply entering an untidy room will distress a Clockfolk, who will likely begin tidying it up immediately. If they find broken objects, they feel the need to repair them. For obvious reasons, this also makes Clockfolk excellent non-magical healers.\r\n\r\n## Statistics\r\n\r\nSize/Type: Medium automaton (humanoid)\r\n\r\nAttributes: STR +1, LOG +2, WIL +2\r\n\r\nSkill Choices: engineering, astronomy, law, history, medicine\r\n\r\n## Exploits\r\n\r\n- Clockwork. As automatons, Clockfolk do not need to eat or breathe. They do, however, need to sleep, in a fashion, as their gears wind down. Like other automatons, Clockfolk are vulnerable (1d6) to electricity (1d6) and ion (2d6) damage. They are immune to attacks that target MENTAL DEFENSE. Like most automatons, Clockfolk cannot have a LUC or MAG score.\r\n- Repair. Once per day, Clockfolk can repair themselves in a patchwork fashion up to half their normal maximum Health by spending two actions and assimilating resources from their environment.\r\n- Wind-Up. Clockfolk can spend two actions winding themselves up. For the next minute, they move at a faster speed (making a rapid clockwork ticking noise while they do so), gaining an extra action each turn, but at the end of the minute they wind down and cannot act or move for one hour.\r\n- Internal Clock. Clockfolk track the passage of time accurately, to the very second.\r\n- Finger Needle. Clockfolk have a special needle which can retract or extend from their finger at-will, and it delivers poison in the following manner. The Clockfolk makes a normal unarmed attack. If it hits, the needle deals the Clockfolk’s natural damage as poison damage. The slender needle can easily slip through chinks in armor, which means it ignores SOAK.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JFx87Jvt7FYtxpXh9T6gFH7KNWIJvLsilTWEab_1B1lEdEumLcB_-rZ8sy5zCOROGz37orYZR3A6cuPPTJLNAEHecI1gYzaTsj4Wf3xFXKRAvc40=w1280)",

All actions in the ambush turn occur simultaneously.\r\n2. Everyone rolls INITIATIVE. This is simply an INTUITION check, although some characters may get bonuses from  skills such as tactics. On a tie, compare AGILITY, and if still tied, simply have each roll 1d6 and the highest wins.\r\n3. All combatants then act in order from highest INITIATIVE to lowest. Each character may take TWO actions unless otherwise noted; larger creatures may have more actions. An action is a move, an attack, or a regular action. You can move twice, or attack twice, or move and attack, or any other combination.  Creatures with 3 actions take two actions on their turn and one action on their INITIATIVE count -10. Those with 4 or more actions take two actions on their turn and one action every 5 INITIATVE counts later up to their total number of actions.\r\n4. Once everybody has acted, return to step 3 and repeat until the combat ends.\r\n\r\n## Turns\r\n\r\nA turn represents a short but unspecified length of time measured in seconds. Most characters have two actions to use each turn, unless they have an ability which says otherwise, and some creatures have more. These actions can be spent to move, fight, or perform other tasks, and can be performed in any order. For example, a character might move and then fire his longbow, or vice versa.\r\n\r\nEach character (unless otherwise noted gets) 2 actions, 1 free action, and 1 reaction per turn.\r\n\r\n## The Ambush Turn\r\n\r\nBefore a fight starts, combatants can attempt to get the jump on each other. In practical terms, that commonly involves one of two things: unexpectedly initiating combat, or ambushing an enemy from hiding. However, it can involve any participant-initiated strategy.\r\n\r\nIf nobody is attempting to ambush the other, or if all combatants encounter each other simultaneously and launch straight into combat, the ambush turn is skipped. Only use the ambush turn if one group is deliberately trying to get the jump on the other. From a PC point of view, the ambush turn can only be accessed if the party specifically attempts to do so before combat begins; once everybody realizes a fight is breaking out, the ambush turn is long past.\r\n\r\nGetting an ambush requires a group check. Either the whole group succeeds, or none of them do. This check is opposed by the leader (or the lookout, or the otherwise most alert or perceptive) of the target group. As always with group checks, success requires more than half the participants to make a successful check.\r\n\r\nAnybody trying to gain access to the ambush turn needs to win an opposed attribute check against the intended targets. This is usually an AGI (stealth) or CHA (bluff), but the GM should allow any reasonable plan from a player.\r\n\r\nAll actions that take place during the ambush turn take place simultaneously, and creatures with access to the ambush turn may take only one action during the ambush turn.",

These damage types are listed in the weapons tables.\r\n\r\nDamage type also determines which condition is inflicted on a target when it suffers a critical hit (triple-sixes on a successful attack roll).\r\n\r\nBecause damage type is a keyword system, there is no finite list of damage types. However, you will find a list of some common types below.\r\n\r\nBlunt. Blunt damage comes from falls, or heavy blunt weapons, and most unarmed combat.\r\n\r\nCrushing. Crushing damage can be caused by large objects or gravity weapons and effects.\r\n\r\nBallistic. Projectile pistols and rifles tend to do ballistic damage.\r\n\r\nCold. Cryo weapons are uncommon, but cold is a common environmental damage.\r\n\r\nDeath/Necrotic. This type of damage is usually referred to as necrotic damage; it is often caused by weapons or creatures channeling magical energies..\r\n\r\nElectricity. Electricity damage can come about in a number of ways, including booby traps; mechanoids are vulnerable 1d6 to electricity damage. Electricity weapons often have the stun trait, meaning that a target reduced to 0 HEALTH with the weapon is knocked unconscious but is not dying.\r\n\r\nEvil/Unholy. This type of damage is usually referred to as unholy damage, and can be caused by weapons or creatures with the Evil virtue.\r\n\r\nForce. Force is a type of energy damage.\r\n\r\nGood/Holy. This type of damage is usually referred to as holy damage, and can be caused by weapons or creatures with the Good virtue.\r\n\r\nHeat. Heat damage is caused by fire, lasers and other energy weapons. It is sometimes referred to as fire damage.\r\n\r\nIon. Ion damage is designed to damage electronics and shields; mechanoids are vulnerable 2d6 to ion damage.\r\n\r\nPiercing. Piercing damage, like slashing damage, can be caused by swords and knives.\r\n\r\nPoison. Poison damage can come about from gas, bioweapons, atmosphere, radiation, food, stingers, bites and more; armor does not soak it unless noted.\r\n\r\nPsionic. Psionic damage is caused not only by psionic powers, but also by some specially designed weapons.\r\n\r\nSlashing. Swords and other slashing weapons do slashing damage.\r\n\r\nSonic. Sonic damage is caused by soundwaves. Armor does not soak it unless noted.\r\n\r\n## Resistance\r\n\r\nSome armor, creatures, objects, or materials have SOAK values based on a damage type. This means that they are particularly good at resisting damage of that type. Fire-resistant armor, for example, might have a SOAK entry which reads SOAK 5 (heat). Many creature stat-blocks will also list resistances (and, in some cases, immunities) to certain damage types. A SOAK value is the amount by which damage of that type is reduced when it affects the target.\r\n\r\nSOAK only applies to attacks which target Defense (not Mental Defense) except for SOAK which specifically designates psychic or psionic damage.\r\n\r\nWhen damage is fully SOAKed, some may still get through—any sixes in the damage roll automatically do 1 point of damage regardless of SOAK. This means that it is always possible to damage a target, even if it’s just a little.\r\n\r\nTargets benefit from resistances only if they are resistant to all listed damage types. A target resistant to heat damage does not benefit from resistance to a weapon which does heat/sonic damage. The target would need to be resistant to both damage types.\r\n\r\n## Vulnerability\r\n\r\nConversely, a creature might be particularly vulnerable to a damage type, as ice creatures are to heat damage. A vulnerability entry will generally note how vulnerable the target is—typically 1d6 or 2d6—and that entry tells you how many extra damage dice to roll when affecting the target (but the maximum is double normal damage). A golem, for example, has vulnerability 1d6 (electricity) which means that an lightning spell which normally does 2d6 electricity damage would do 3d6 electricity damage to the golem.\r\n\r\nTargets suffer from vulnerability if the keyword is listed amongst a weapon’s damage types.\r\n\r\nNote that if a creature is vulnerable to something, its natural SOAK doesn't work against that thing. However, any SOAK other than its natural SOAK (including armor) applies as normal.",

          "Markdown": "# Dual-Wielding\r\n\r\nSometimes a character might have a weapon in each hand. This might be a pair of knives, or a pair of pistols; it might be a sword and a dagger; it even includes – technically – the use of a sword and shield. Dual-wielding also includes the use of double weapons, such as a two-bladed sword.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, any single-handed item (weapon or shield) can be used for offense or defense. Most items can be used for offense, including shields; shields and weapons with the Shield trait can be used for defense. Even improvised weapons and other items can be used, although they are subject to the usual improvisation penalties, which may make them near useless to all but the most proficient of combatants.\r\n\r\n## Defense\r\n\r\nWhen a shield or a weapon with the Shield trait is used for defense, it grants a bonus to the wielder’s DEFENSE scores. An item is assumed to be used for defense unless it is specifically used for offense. Double weapons and missile weapons cannot usually be used for defense, and weapons with the Shield trait only apply to MELEE DEFENSE.\r\n\r\n## Offense\r\n\r\nWhen a shield or a weapon is used for offense it cannot grant a defensive bonus to the wielder until the start of his next turn. Instead, once per turn, it grants an additional attack as a free action if the wielder has attacked twice already in the round (in other words, the wielder can spend two actions to get three attacks – two with the primary weapon, and one with the off-hand weapon). If an off-hand weapon is used for offense, all the character’s attacks for that round are subjected to a -2d6 die penalty.\r\n\r\n## Attributes\r\n\r\nDual-wielding characters must use their AGI attribute to attack with their secondary weapon. They cannot use STR (melee) or INT (ranged).\r\n\r\n## Ambidexterity\r\n\r\nCharacters with the Ambidexterity trait do not suffer the -2d6 penalty to attacks when dual-wielding. Shields. As mentioned above, shields can also be used in offense. Shields typically do 1d6 blunt damage (or 1d6 piercing damage for a spiked shield).\r\n\r\n## Exploits\r\n\r\nYou can incorporate exploits into attacks, but exploits can only each be used once per round as normal (and thus usually only apply to one attack).\r\n\r\n## Unarmed attacks\r\n\r\nWhen making unarmed attacks, your body counts as one weapon. You cannot dual-wield two fists or a head and a knee; you are simply using your single body to attack. You can dual wield a one-handed weapon and an unarmed attack.",

          "Markdown": "# Making An Attack\r\n\r\nAttacks take the form of ranged attacks or melee attacks. A ranged attack uses a bow, gun, thrown weapon, or other form of ranged weapon. A melee attack is either unarmed (punches, kicks, claws, bites, and the like) or uses a melee weapon such as a sword or club.\r\n\r\n## Making An Attack\r\n\r\nSpending attack dice is an important part of combat, and without it a character may find it difficult to do much damage. It is fundamental to the way that powerful or accurate attacks do a lot of damage or achieve special effects. The larger your dice pool, the more you have to spend on damage and effects. Follow this process:\r\n\r\n1. Form your dice pool from attribute + skill + equipment up to your maximum dice pool.\r\n\r\n2. Adjust the dice pool for positional factors (cover, range, etc.)\r\n\r\n3. Choose how much of the dice pool to spend on damage and effects. Add any bonuses or costs from exploits.\r\n\r\n4. You may add LUCK dice, which enables you to exceed your maximum dice pool. Spending on damage.\r\n\r\nSpending on effects. Your exploits tell you what effects you can spend attack dice on. You can spend dice on knockdowns, disarms, blinding attacks, trips, arm-locks, and many more effects.\r\n\r\nRemember, the maximum dice pool limit applies to the initial attribute + skills + equipment dice pool. Positions, exploits, and LUC can all exceed that limit once it has been formed.\r\n\r\n## Attack Rolls\r\n\r\nAttack rolls are attribute checks, and are made as follows:\r\n\r\n- A melee attack is performed by rolling a STR or AGI check (attacker's choice unless otherwise noted) against the target's melee DEFENSE.\r\n- A ranged attack is performed by rolling an AGI or INT check (attacker's choice unless otherwise noted) against the target's RANGED DEFENSE. Longer ranges can reduce the number of dice rolled.\r\n- On a successful hit, the attacker rolls damage(in d6s) according to the weapon. Armor reduces this damage by its SOAK value. The resulting damage is deducted from the target's HEALTH.\r\n- Magical attacks work like other attacks (typically a MAG check against the target's DEFENSE or MENTAL DEFENSE) and do damage or have effects according to the spell's description.\r\n- Psionic attacks use a PSI check vs the target's DEFENSE or MENTAL DEFENSE.\r\n- Called shots, area attacks, poisons, and other attacks vs. a target's consitition are made vs the target's VITAL DEFENSE.\r\n\r\n## Attack Options\r\n\r\nWhen you make an attack, choose one of the following options as long as (a) it makes sense, and (b) the target is not immune to that condition or action. You cannot, for example, disarm a tiger, trip a snake, or grab a hologram.\r\n\r\n- Damage. Make any attack normally and if you hit you inflict your normal damage.\r\n\r\n    - Power attack. You can pay 1d6 to do +1d6 damage. You can stack as many bonus damage dice as you wish by paying 1d6 for each extra die of damage.\r\n- Grab. Make an unarmed melee attack normally and if you hit you grab your target, giving it the Restrained condition. You must pay an additional 1d6 for each size category that the target is larger than you, and also if the target has more than two legs or has no legs. You can apply this condition twice to increase the level of the Restrained condition.\r\n- Escape. Make an unarmed melee attack or an attack with a small melee weapon normally and if you hit you escape a grab and remove the Restrained condition.\r\n\r\n### Called Shots\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may pay 2d6 to make a Called Shot and if you also beat the target's VITAL DEFENSE you can apply one of the following effects.\r\n\r\n- Push. Make a Called Shot with a melee or ranged attack and if you hit you move your target one square (plus up to one square for each size category by which you exceed the target in melee, or by which your weapon exceeds the target at range). You must pay an additional 1d6 for each size category that the target is larger than you, and also if the target has more than two legs or has no legs. The movement must be one which makes sense, and if it is a result of a blow or ranged attack, will always be a push away from you.\r\n- Trip. Make a Called Shot and if you hit you knock or trip your target prone. You must pay an additional 1d6 for each size category that the target is larger than you, and also if the target has more than two legs or has no legs.\r\n- Disarm. Make a Called Shot and if you hit you disarm your opponent, giving it the Disarmed condition. This only applies to an opponent wielding a weapon.\r\n- Injure. Make a Called Shot and if you hit you disable your target, giving it the Slowed condition.\r\n- Other. Make a Called Shot specific to that target as outlined in its stat-block.\r\n\r\n## Damage\r\n\r\nDamage is indicated as a dice range, and is deducted from the target's HEALTH.  SOAK reduces damage before it is applied to HEALTH.\r\n\r\nSpending on damage. Everybody can spend attack dice on damage; this allows you to choose between easier, less damaging attacks or more difficult, more damaging attacks. Before making an attack roll, spend one die for each extra die of damage you wish to do. A base attack, with no dice spent on extra damage, will often be easy but have little effect.\r\n\r\n- Even if all damage is SOAKED, each 6 rolled for damage does 1 point of damage anyway.\r\n- A [critical hit](/combat/critical-hits) is scored when the attacker rolls three or more sixes on their attack roll and the attack roll is high enough to hit the target and the target is not immune to the damage type (note that if the attack roll is not high enough to hit the target, three sixes is an automatic hit, but not a critical hit).\r\n\r\n### SOAK\r\n\r\nThere are three types of SOAK: natural, armor, and special (which includes SOAK granted by magic). The different types of SOAK don’t stack with each other; you use the best available. For example, if you have 5 natural SOAK and 8 armor SOAK, you apply 8 SOAK any time you are struck by an arrow.\r\n\r\nThese types of SOAK interact differently with certain damage types. You always use the best which applies against the specific damage type involved.\r\n\r\nIn addition to most weapon damage, natural SOAK protects against falling, acid, and gas- and liquid-based damage. Armor SOAK, on the other hand, does not protect against falling, acid, or gas- or liquid-based damage.\r\n\r\nPsychic/psionic damage is only SOAKed where specified.",

          "Markdown": "# Combat Actions\r\n\r\nThe actions in this section are available to all player characters and NPCs. You do not need to have access to any particular ability to use them (other than the aim, focus, and feint actions, which are exploits which every character gets one of for free).\r\n\r\nWhile characters typically have two actions to use in each turn, there are additional action types which can be taken:\r\n\r\n- Free actions use none of the character’s actions, and must be taken in the character’s turn. Only one free action is permitted to a character per round.\r\n- Reactions take place outside a character’s turn in response to a specified trigger. Many exploits provide reactions. Only one reaction is permitted to a character per round.\r\n- Bonus actions can be provided by spending a Luck die. Only one Luck die can be spent by a character in this way per turn. Bonus actions take place in the character’s own turn.\r\n\r\nEven if a creature is able to use more than two actions in a turn, it cannot repeat a given action more than twice. For example, a creature with 3 actions can only move twice, not three times.\r\n\r\nEach character (unless otherwise noted gets) 2 actions, 1 free action, and 1 reaction per turn.\r\n\r\n## Move\r\n\r\nA character can move up to her SPEED in squares. A diagonal square counts as 1 square but you cannot move diagonally round a 90-degree corner.\r\n\r\nA character can also climb and jump to navigate scenery.\r\n\r\n- Climbing takes place at HALF SPEED; only one AGI check is needed per turn, at the most difficult part of the climb. A character's CLIMB SPEED is noted on his character sheet.\r\n- Jumping is “free” as part of the distance moved in a move action up as far as a character's horizontal and vertical jump scores, which are noted on his character sheet.\r\n- Difficult terrain halves ground movement rates.\r\n- If a character moves and takes an action, the action can take place at any point during that movement.\r\n- Falling causes 1d6 damage for every 10' fallen; this is not SOAKed. A fall results in the character falling prone unless they make an AGI check with a difficulty value equal to the number of feet fallen.\r\n- Using a non-primary movement mode such as climbing, swimming, or flying always requires an attribute check.  A non-primary movement mode is one which is not designated as natural or primary. A creature with a primary movement mode does not need to make attribute checks to do so, and simply moves its SPEED in the designated manner.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/IxkjZo71NnaWih9uF5PrXAEneSXbgIgjL2xL6FrqpvsBwqz7nNUrG6ZU7tpICG4J273gaVQe1GM-g6nX8gglUx6CgiJAvds1V9BzCAqjW8pzgyOo=w1280)\r\n\r\n## Aim/Feint/Focus\r\n\r\nAiming, focusing, or feinting, all of which are universal exploits, cost one action, and grant +1d6 bonus to an attack roll taken in the same turn. The attack action must come immediately after the aiming, focus, or feinting action. All characters get either Aim, Focus, or Feint for free.\r\n\r\n## Overwatch\r\n\r\nOverwatch is a special type of action. When you choose to overwatch, you wait ready with a ranged weapon to fire on any targets which make themselves available. Usually this means targets which break cover and enter your line of sight.\r\n\r\nYou may only fire on a given target once during a turn when on overwatch, and may only fire when the target has zero cover. Your shot interrupts his turn at the earliest point possible.\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of targets you can fire upon during a turn when in overwatch is equal to your INTUITION attribute. Each subsequent target beyond the first takes a -1d6 penalty to hit.\r\n\r\nGoing into overwatch ends your turn.\r\n\r\n## Suppressive Fire\r\n\r\nYou can lay down fire in a particular area in order to “cover” an ally's exposed movement or action which would normally attract overwatch attacks.\r\n\r\nUnlike most attack types, suppressive fire is not target-dependent. It depends on your ally. You designate a specific ally as the beneficiary of your suppressive fire; this benefit last until your ally's next turn has ended. During that turn, you ally's actions gain the benefit of COVER, even when he or she is exposed. This means that your ally will automatically be immune to overwatch, and gains some protection from regular fire.\r\n\r\nSome weapons, noted as “auto” in the equipment lists, are especially efficient at suppressive fire. These weapons gain your ally an additional 1d6 of cover.\r\n\r\nWeapons with the Single trait cannot provide suppressive fire.",

          "Markdown": "# Positional Effects\r\n\r\nCombat in What's OLD is NEW is a highly positional, tactical affair. Using crossfires and avoiding getting pinned down or falling into the enemy’s crossfires, combatants move about the battlemap in an attempt to gain an advantage over their foes.\r\n\r\n### Facing\r\n\r\nThe direction you face can matter when using miniatures in combat. It determines whether somebody is attacking you from the rear, and which directions certain attacks can be used in.\r\n\r\nYou can change which direction you face at any time while moving. If you don't move in your turn, you can still change your facing for free at any point turing your turn. This is not an actual action or a free action.\r\n\r\nMost attacks can be used in any direction. However, occasionally an attack will only be valid in a particular direction - a xenomorph's tail swipe affects a cone to its rear, for example. If this is the case, the attack (or exploit) will specify that direction.\r\n\r\nThe four important positional effects are range, higher ground, cover, and crossfires/flanks.\r\n\r\n## Range\r\n\r\nIn ranged combat, every weapon has a range increment. Any ranged attack which exceeds that range increment suffers a -1d6 die penalty for each range increment beyond the first. Unless otherwise noted, weapons can only fire out to five range increments.\r\n\r\n## Higher Ground\r\n\r\nCombatants on higher ground than their targets gain a +1d6 bonus to attack them. Higher ground is defined as at least 5' for melee attacks or at least 10' for ranged attacks.\r\n\r\n## Cover\r\n\r\nCover is very important. Targets without cover are very vulnerable to enemy bowshots and spellcasting. A target in cover inflicts a -2d6 penalty to attack rolls made against him (although this can be alleviated by the “pinned down” rule, below).\r\n\r\nIt's important to distinguish between cover and a blocked line-of sight. A character cannot be completely immune to fire and simultaneously able to fire himself, and cannot be in a position where line of sight is completely blocked except for when he pops up to fire.\r\n\r\nThere are three positions which require a move action to switch between:\r\n\r\nOPEN. A character without the benefit of any cover is considered in the OPEN.\r\n\r\nCOVER. If a character can fire on an enemy without expending a move action, he is IN COVER; line of sight is not blocked.\r\n\r\nBLOCKED. If a character must expend a move action in order to fire upon an enemy, line of sight is BLOCKED. The move action need not involve leaving the square, but it is important that the move action is needed to move to a firing position, and another one is needed to move back to the fully blocked position.\r\n\r\n## Crossfire/Flank\r\n\r\nIn an exchange of ranged bowshot and spellfire, every soldier dreads being caught in a crossfire. Avoiding missiles from multiple directions is extremely difficult. A crossfire is also known as interlocking fire, as each bowman's arcs of fire mutually support one another.\r\n\r\nA crossfire exists if two attackers are positioned at 90-degree or greater angles to each other with respect to the target. Each of the attackers beyond the first grants a cumulative +1d6 bonus to ranged attacks against that target (making a maximum bonus of +3d6 for four attackers).\r\n\r\nA flank is the melee equivalent of a crossfire.  It requires two diametrically opposite attackers, and grants a maximum of +1d6 to melee attacks against the target.\r\n\r\n## Other Modifiers\r\n\r\nOther things can affect an attack roll.\r\n\r\n- It is harder to shoot someone engaged in melee combat without endangering your ally. Such attacks take a -2d6 cover penalty, although some exploits can reduce this.\r\n- Similarly, in darkness or under cover of obscuring fog or smoke, a -2d6 cover penalty is inflicted.\r\n- A prone target is harder to hit at range (a penalty of -1d6) but easier to hit in melee (+2d6).",

          "Markdown": "# Compulsion Enhancements\r\n\r\nCompel [creature] or [virtue]\r\n\r\nCompulsion spells reflect classic “telepathy”: mindreading, control, and thought-sending. Compel spells force creatures to act certain ways. Weaker compulsions let you set a specific task for the character to perform, while more powerful compulsions give you ongoing control of the creature’s actions.\r\n\r\nIf a creature is successfully affected by a compel spell, it obeys your commands to the best of its ability. Low-MP compel spells are language dependent, and thus creatures are allowed to obey the letter of your commands, rather than the spirit. The more powerful the spell, the more control you have, and the more complicated actions you can command.\r\n\r\nEach round, creatures can try to shake a compulsion off. Obviously suicidal commands are ignored, and dangerous acts grant a +1d6 bonus to the check.\r\n\r\nA compel cantrip can allow you to issue a simple one word command to a target or send a one-word telepathic message to an ally.\r\n\r\n## Charm\r\n\r\nCompulsion. Cost varies. You inflict the Charmed condition. The standard condition costs 2 MP, while the extreme condition costs 4 MP. The condition is a temporary one which can be shaken off normally; however, you can make it persistent by doubling this enhancement’s MP cost.\r\n\r\nSubtle Compulsion. Cost 3 MP. The creature is unaware that it has been controlled, and cannot shake off the effect, which lasts for a set duration (which must be purchased). If the spell also contains charm enhancements, this enhancement also functions as the Subtle Charm enhancement. You only need to buy one. Without this enhancement, creatures will be aware that they are being affected.\r\n\r\n## Communication\r\n\r\nMessage. Cost 1 MP. As Send Emotion, but with speech; however, this does not allow you or the target creature to understand additional languages.\r\n\r\nCommunicate. Cost 4 MP. As Message, but you can communicate clearly regardless of language.\r\n\r\nSend Emotion. Cost 0 MP. You can communicate simple concepts to creatures in the area of effect, like friendship or emotion, but you cannot communicate actual language. You can only communicate as long as the creature is within range. The creature can choose to reply in kind, but this gives you no power to know what it doesn’t want to tell you. You can use this on willing targets to allow easy communication, but unwilling creatures require an attack roll as normal.\r\n\r\nSenselink. Cost 1 MP. As Send Emotion, but you can sense whatever the creature is sensing, and you can impart your senses to it. Pain can be understood, but damage does not cross over this link.\r\n\r\n## Telepathy\r\n\r\nErase. Cost varies. You inflict the Forgetful condition. The standard condition costs 2 MP, while the extreme condition costs 4 MP.\r\n\r\nMind Modify. Cost 4 MP. By concentrating, you can rewrite the creature’s memory or knowledge. The knowledge or modification only lasts as long as the spell’s duration, and you must about one round concentrating to change the creature’s memory. You can choose to rewrite several pieces of simple information (password, the location he’s currently at, which way the prisoners went), or rewrite a complex piece of information (making a guard think he’s an escapee, imparting knowledge equal to a skill rank or one spell, or changing his memory of the lyrics of a song), or modify the memory of a single event. What constitutes an event varies, but can include several related small events covering no more than a month.\r\n\r\nMind Read. Cost 4 MP. By concentrating, you can deeply read the mind of the creature. Each round, you can either search for specific information (e.g., the name of a spy, the location of hidden treasure, the gate password) or simply browsing for interesting information. Browsing for general information normally garners nothing very urgent or secretive unless the creature was recently thinking about it, but gives you a broader sense of the creature’s mind. You can only browse one creature at a time, but if there are multiple creatures in the area, you can look for specific information in all of them at once.\r\n\r\nMind Scan. Cost 1 MP. By concentrating, you can “overhear” the thoughts of the creature. If there are multiple creatures in the area, you can focus on one at a time, or try to decipher out their thoughts all at once, like hearing one person in a crowded room. This does not give you the ability to understand the creature’s language, but you can comprehend emotions and simple desires like fear or hunger regardless of language. The affected creature can attempt to shake this off each round.\r\n\r\nMindwipe. Cost 6 MP. You completely erase all the creature’s memories and knowledge. You must concentrate for a full minute to accomplish this. The target must be within range for the entire modification. This only lasts for the duration of the spell.\r\n\r\nShared Perception. Cost 3 MP + 1 MP per additional sense. You can use the senses of a creature within the area of effect. The duration of the spell must be concentration, and you gain access to one of the creature’s senses: sight, hearing, smell, taste, and/or touch. For each additional MP you spend, you gain access to one more sense, for a maximum of 7 MP for all five senses. However, any such sense you access replaces your own equivalent sense for the duration; this can render you effectively blind or deaf (as per the conditions). You also gain access to the creature’s Perception score (and, if you have the appropriate sense linked, any additional specific Perception scores such as scent or hearing).\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\n\r\nTelepathic Command. Cost 1 MP. More powerful than a verbal command, you can instruct another creature using only your mind. You must use this exploit to modify a verbal command exploit.\r\n\r\nVerbal Command. Cost varies. The target must be able to hear and understand you. For 0 MP you can give the target a one or two word command, which it obeys, though it may distort your intent. For 2 MP your command can be one or two sentences long, detailing a single slightly complex task. Once you finish casting the spell, the command doesn’t take effect until you finish telling the target, so you might need to rush if the target is threatening you. For 5 MP the command can be as long or complex as you want. The more complex the command, often the more easily the target can distort its intention, but the main limiting factor is how much time the spell lasts. Commands can only be instantaneous spells. For longer periods of control, use the Compulsion enhancement.",

          "Markdown": "# Conditions\n\nEach condition has three effects. In the lists below, the first time a condition is inflicted, the target suffers from the**initial condition** in the first bullet-point. If they are affected twice by a condition, this is called a **severe condition**, and the second bullet-point is used. Finally, the third bullet-point describes **extreme conditions**.\n\n    1. Initial\n    2. Severe\n    3. Extreme\n\nConditions can represent different things—paralysis might be caused by freezing, petrifaction, entanglement, and so on, and blindness might be a medical issue or the result of a blindfold. The desriptions below tell you the basic mechanical effect, but these should be embellished and descrbed narratively.\n\n**Stacking.** Conditions levels stack.  You suffer the lower effects of a condition also; however numerical values do not stack. For example, if you have the severe Bleeding condition, you suffer 2d6 damage per round, not 3d6 damage.\n\n## Removing Conditions\n\nShaking off temporary conditions is simple: just roll 1d6. On a roll of 5 or 6, the condition is removed.\n\nShaking off a specific condition takes one action, and can only be attempted once per turn. Conditions which do not allow you to take actions still allow you to try to shake off conditions (in effect, all conditions have a chance of simply ending on their own).\n\nYou may use multiple actions to try to shake off multiple conditions.\n\nAt the GM’s discretion, suitable methods can be used to end a condition (diving into water when on fire, for example).\n\nShaking off a condition is an action; it might be a physical action (wiping blood from your eyes to remove the Blind condition), or an effort of will (summoning up the courage to ignore the Afraid condition). It might even involve healing or application of medicine.\n\nRemoving a severe condition removes that condition in its entirety; it does not reduce the condition down to its lower state.\n\nAll temporary conditions end after five minutes, even if they are not shaken off.\n\n## Persistent Conditions\n\nSome conditions cannot be shaken off. Persistent conditions are not cleared until the creature gets a full night’s rest unless another duration is specified. Some conditions cannot be persistent (these are ongoing damage conditions which would kill any creature long before the day was out). These are marked with an asterisk.\n\n## List of Conditions\n\n### Afraid\n\nThe target displays fear towards the attacker.\n\n    1. You cannot approach the source of your fear.\n    2. You must flee the source of your fear, or simply cower if that is not possible.\n    3. You are mad with fear, utterly terrified, and screaming incoherently. You may take no other action than to flee or cower, and you take 1d6 psychic damage each round. It is possible that you might die from sheer terror!\\*\n\n### Angry\n\nThe target feels irrational anger.\n\n    1. You cannot take any non-attack actions other than moving directly towards an enemy.\n    2. You must attack the nearest foe. If none are available, you must attack the nearest ally.\n    3. You are utterly incoherent with rage. You attack the nearest creature, bloodlust on your mind. You do +1d6 damage, but you no longer defend yourself; your RANGED and MELEE DEFENSES become 10.\n\n### Bleeding\\*\n\nThe target suffers ongoing damage from a lingering wound.\n\n    1. You take 1d6 damage at the start of your turn.\n    2. You take 2d6 damage at the start of your turn.\n    3. You take 2d6 damage at the start of your turn and you start bleeding out. Form a dying countdown; this applies even if you are still conscious, and you will die if it expires.\n\n### Blind\n\nThe target’s vision is obscured by a helm, blood, or wound.\n\n    1. Your vision is limited to 30’, and you move at half SPEED. You cannot benefit from flanks or crossfires.\n    2. You cannot see, cannot use ranged weapons, move at half Speed, and suffer –2d6 to all sight-based actions.\n    3. You cannot see, cannot use ranged weapons, move at half Speed, and suffer –2d6 to all sight-based actions. You cannot defend yourself; your RANGED and MELEE DEFENSES become 10.\n\n### \n\nBurning\\*\n\nThe target suffers ongoing damage from fire, acid, or a similar substance.\n\n    1. You take 1d6 fire damage per round. Clothes are ruined.\n    2. You take 2d6 fire damage per round. Clothes, hair, and eyebrows are ruined.\n    3. You take 3d6 fire damage per round. Clothes, hair, and all non-metal equipment is ruined, and you cannot hold any metal equipment. If you are wearing metal armor, you take 4d6 fire damage per round instead.\n\n### Charmed\n\nThe target feels friendship and loyalty towards the attacker.\n\n    1. You will not attack the source of the charm, nor will you willingly allow harm to come to them; neither do you provide flank or crossfire bonuses against them.\n    2. You will obey commands which do not overly conflict with your nature or which are obviously harmful to you.\n    3. You are utterly dominated by the attacker, and will obey any command, even those against your nature or which may cause you harm.\n\n### Confused\n\nThe target is confused and unsure of his surroundings.\n\n    1. You drop any items you are holding and cannot tell friend from foe.\n    2. Roll 1d6 to determine your condition each turn: (1) afraid, (2) angry, (3) forgetful, (4) manic, (5) drunk, (6) dazed.\n    3. As (2) but you gain the severe degree of the condition.\n\n### Cursed\n\nA cloud of misfortune surrounds you.\n\n1. You cannot spend any LUC dice.\n\n2.

You are prone, rolling around on the floor with laughter; your RANGED and MELEE DEFENSES become 10.\n\n### Pained\n\nAn injury causes the target pain in sufficient degree that it restricts movement.\n\n    1. You take 1d6 damage if you take a second action in a turn.\n    2. You take 1d6 damage if you take any actions.\n    3.

          "Markdown": "# Creation Enhancements\r\n\r\nCreate [element]\r\n\r\nCreation spells let you make objects or energy out of nothing. You cannot create creatures, and any energy you create is no more damaging than the weakest evocation, but many other effects are possible.\r\n\r\nThe specifics of your creation spell is up to you and your Game Master to decide. Does a creation spell summon objects from other dimensions, or does it create objects whole cloth? When the spell ends, does the object just vanish, or dissolve into mist, or perhaps burst into hundreds of skittering insects that disappear into the nearest nooks and crannies? When you create weapons or clothes, you can create them in the hands or on the bodies of willing subjects; you cannot force them to appear on the unwilling.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the spell’s duration, the object you created goes away entirely. If you make nails and use them to hold up a painting, the nails will vanish when the spell ends, and the painting will fall. Created dirt and mud that soils clothing will leave the clothes clean when the spell ends. If you create water and boil pasta in it, when the spell ends the water will disappear from the pasta and leave it dry.\r\n\r\nCreated materials always have some special “air” about them that make them seem unnatural. This is not enough to make people or animals uneasy, but an experienced person can easily determine that an item is magically created.\r\n\r\nAs a restriction of the rules, you cannot use a creation spell as a directly offensive spell that is unavoidable: you cannot create a metal block over a creature that will unavoidably crush it—the creature will be granted at least a roll to get out of the way.\r\n\r\nA create cantrip can create a tiny object worth no more than 5 gc which lasts for up to one round.\r\n\r\nAlso as a general guideline, you can never create something (like lava) inside a creature, nor can you create something if it would displace solid matter; you can only create objects in air, water, or other fluids. If you want a spell that injures by creating things inside a creature, choose an evocation effect.\r\n\r\nIt is still possible to create hazardous things, like flames, lava, or a vacuum, but usually creatures can escape such substances quickly. Higher level spells can trap creatures in a hazardous area.\r\n\r\nRegardless of what specific enhancements you get for a creation spell, the total MP spent on a creation spell also determines the maximum monetary value of item you can create—300 gc per MP spent (round up). This monetary value refers to both craftsmanship and materials. For example, a suit of armor that costs 2,000 gc normally would need at least 7 MP.\r\n\r\n## Creation\r\n\r\nCreate Object. Cost varies. You can create almost any object. The basic cost of a creation depends on its size, determined by the area of effect of the spell, and the value (in other words, you just pay for the area; you don’t need to pay for the object itself). If you don’t buy any area of effect, you can create objects no larger than a human-sized longsword or a set of clothes. While the majority of the object much match the secret (create stone, create wood, etc.), minor elements (about 10%) can be of materials to which you do not possess the secret. Thus a set of clothing can have metal buttons, or a stone building can have wooden doors.\r\n\r\n## Elements\r\n\r\nElemental Object. Cost varies. You can create an object out of elemental force rather than actual matter. This enhancement simply doubles the basic cost of the creation’s area. The object is solid, but can take any form you want. If used to create a weapon, the weapon does elemental damage of the appropriate type (fire, cold, etc.) If used to create some other type of object, there may be other effects, detailed in the entry for each element. You can always safely handle objects you create yourself, but others can be harmed if they try to walk on a bridge made of fire. Elemental objects are considered to be steel for the purposes of determining their statistics, but they weigh onehundredth of the weight an equivalent steel object would weigh.\r\n\r\nElemental Damage. Cost 1 MP. For elements which cause damage (acid, fire, ice, lava, lightning) you can increase the normal 1 damage to 1d6 for 1 MP. For more damage, you need to use evocation enhancements. Choose an element for which you know the secret.\r\n\r\nAcid. Elemental objects created of acid are mild, and deal 1 point of acid damage per round to anyone who touches them. Stronger acid is not available as a creation. If you want to hurt things with acid, see the section on evocations.\r\n\r\nAir. When you create air, you can choose its temperature, between extremes of –40 and 150 degrees Fahrenheit (–40 and 65 degrees Celsius). Severe heat and cold cannot be used offensively unless you have a way to keep someone from moving out of the area of effect, since it takes a while to die of exposure. The air in the area can be breathed for the duration; if a creature is the target, the spell enables them to breathe fresh air for the duration. For an additional 1 MP, a moderate wind of up to 20 mph can be created. For 2 MP, the wind is strong (up to 50 mph), and for 5 MP it is a hurricane of over 100 mph. For 8 MP a tornado with winds of up to 300 mph can be created.\r\n\r\nThis exploit can also be used to create a type of weather within the area of effect natural to the local climate and season which takes 10 minutes to develop, and fades when the spell’s duration ends. The duration must be at least 10 minutes to use it in this manner, but the area cost is one-quarter normal (round down).\r\n\r\nFire. Elemental objects created of fire deal 1 point of damage per round to anyone who touches them (normal fire deals 1d6 damage per round).\r\n\r\nForce (6 MP). Force objects exist both materially and ethereally, affecting incorporeal creatures. They count as forcefields for determining stats.\r\n\r\nIce. Elemental objects created of ice deal 1 point of damage per round to anyone who touches them (normal ice deals 1d6 damage per round).\r\n\r\nLava. Elemental objects created of lava deal 1 point of damage per round to anyone who touches them (normal lava deals a base of 1d6 damage per round of exposure). You can’t create lava that surrounds and engulfs a creature, but it’s certainly possible to create enough lava to push creatures into.\r\n\r\nLife. You can create any sort of object of once living matter, such as clothes, wooden desks, food, or boats. You could even create a corpse. (The market price of a corpse varies wildly depending on its nature.) Life is not actually created; “life” in this context means “organic matter.” Food created in this way lasts 15 minutes (this duration does not need to be purchased with additional MP), and if it is consumed by a creature, it sustains the creature as though it were real in every respect.\r\n\r\nLight. Light creates bright illumination in the spell’s area of effect, and dim light for a further distance equal to half the spell’s radius. For an additional 3 MP, the light can be made so bright that no shadows are cast, and any who see this bright light are subject to a MAG vital attack that inflicts the Blind condition.\r\n\r\nLightning. Elemental objects created of lightning deal 1 point of damage per round to anyone who touches them (normal lightning deals 1d6 damage per round).\r\n\r\nMist. A fog cloud obscures vision beyond 5'. A creature within 5' has concealment (–2d6 die penalty to hit it). Fog and mist can be dispersed by a moderate wind (11+ mph) in 4 rounds, or by a strong wind (21+ mph) in 1 round.\r\n\r\nOoze (3 MP). Ooze objects are semi-solid, and can only be moved through at a rate of 5' per round. Melee attacks made in the area suffer a –1d6 die penalty to attack and damage rolls. Ranged attacks are impossible. The created object looks normal.\r\n\r\nShadow. Shadow creates darkness in the spell’s area of effect, and dim light for a further distance equal to half the spell’s radius. Creatures with darksight can see through this area normally. For an additional 1 MP, the darkness becomes impenetrable even to those with darksight, but does not have an additional dim light perimeter.\r\n\r\nSound. The spell creates actual, not illusory, sound somewhere within the spell’s range that dissipates normally with distance. The sound is simple and repetitive, and is roughly as loud as four men talking. For an additional 1 MP, the sound can be as complex as a conversation, or simple musical quartet, and as loud as a crowd of shouting men. For 5 MP, the sound can be literally deafening, attacking all who hear it with a MAG vs. Defense check or becoming inflicted with the severe Deaf condition.\r\n\r\nVoid. The spell creates a vacuum, emptying the area of effect of liquids and gases. You can use this to snuff flames or suffocate creatures.\r\n\r\nWater. The spell creates pure water. Water created in this way to fill one or more drinking vessels lasts 15 minutes (this duration does not need to be purchased by additional MP), and if it is drunk by a creature, it sustains the creature as though it were real in every respect.\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n\r\nPocket Dimension. Cost varies. You can use create space to create a pocket dimension, with an entrance big enough for you to walk through (though you may choose to make it smaller). You create the entrance anywhere within range. If you are inside, you can close or reopen the entrance with two actions. The area of effect you choose is the size of the pocket dimension, and also defines the cost in MP of the dimension—the MP cost of the pocket dimension is equal to twice the normal area of effect cost. Anything in the area of effect is effectively removed from the rest of the world. The interior of the pocket dimension is bare, and it ends without any apparent solid walls. Temperature and air within are the same as those without when the dimension is created. If the spell’s duration ends, anything in the area of effect is expelled. The pocket dimension expires when the duration of the spell expires. You can include for free items using creation spells up to half the MP cost of the dimension itself (so if you created an 18 MP pocket dimension, it can include up to 9 MP worth of free creations).\r\n\r\nRestrain. Cost varies. You inflict the Restrained condition. The standard condition costs 2 MP, while the severe condition costs 4 MP. The condition is a temporary one which can be shaken off normally; however, you can make it persistent by doubling this enhancement’s MP cost.",

          "Markdown": "# Detecting & Identifying Magic\r\n\r\nThe word “spellcraft” is a broad term that refers to an academic understanding of magic. A character can know a lot about magic without actually having any magical ability himself—he is still able to identify the tell-tale traces of magic, work out what items do, know about the history of great mages and recognize their handiwork, and so on. These actions are not spells; they are simply applications of intelligence, perception, and knowledge, and as such they require INTUITION or LOGIC attribute checks.\r\n\r\nSpellcraft has two common applications: detecting magic and identifying magical effects or items. Detecting magic requires an INT check, while identifying magic requires a LOG check. Both applications benefit greatly from the spellcraft skill.\r\n\r\n## Spellcraft & Skills\r\n\r\nIn addition to spellcraft itself, the following skills can also be very useful when making attribute checks related to spellcraft.\r\n\r\nHistory can help with identifying artifacts and recalling ancient lore.\r\n\r\nBlacksmith, armorer, and weaponsmith can help with identifying magical weapons and armor.\r\n\r\nHerbalism and alchemy can help with the preparation and use of potions and concoctions.\r\n\r\nMagical skills like abjuration, evocation, compulsion, etc. relate to broad types of magic. These help when casting spells.\r\n\r\n## Detecting Magic\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, supernatural ways to detect magic: some races (Grand Elves in particular) are able to intuitively feel the presence of magic and can sense magic within 30' instantly with no attribute check.Additionally, divination magic can be much more efficient at locating or identifying magical effects, spells, and devices.\r\n\r\nOther characters can detect the presence of magic within 10' with a Difficult [16] INT check by inspecting the surroundings and identifying subtle but telltale signs. Each attempt to detect magic in this manner takes one minute and requires active examination. If you succeed with the check, you know whether there is any magic within 10', but not its level of power or type, or the number of effects. You can also tell whether any given creature in the area has magical or spellcasting abilities.\r\n\r\nWith a Demanding [21] check, you can determine the approximate power level of the most powerful effect in the area from ambient (up to 1 MP), faint (up to 5 MP), moderate (up to 10 MP), strong (up to 20 MP), and overwhelming (over 20 MP).\r\n\r\nIf you beat a Strenuous [25] INT check you know roughly how many different magical effects there are, and what their general power levels are, but if there are more than spells in the area of effect than the value of your INT score, it is too difficult to untangle the specific spell powers.\r\n\r\nTask \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDifficulty\r\n\r\nDetect the presence of magic within 10' \t\t\t\t\tDifficult [16]\r\n\r\nDetermine the approximate power level of the most \r\n\tpowerful effect in the area\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDemanding [21]\r\n\r\nKnow roughly how many different magical effects \r\n\tthere are, and what their general power levels are\t\tStrenuous [25]\r\n\r\n## Magic Power Levels\r\n\r\nEffect Cost \t\tPower Level\r\n\r\nUp to 1 MP \t\tAmbient\r\n\r\n2–5 MP \t\t\tFaint\r\n\r\n6–10 MP \t\t\tModerate\r\n\r\n11–20 MP \t\tStrong\r\n\r\n21+ MP \t\t\tOverwhelming\r\n\r\n## Identifying Magic\r\n\r\nA magic item or effect can be identified with a Difficult [16] LOG check. Each attempt to identify magic requires one hour. If you succeed with the check, you can identify a single spell effect, and what it does. On a magical item, you can identify one spell that is bound to the item.\r\n\r\nIf you beat a Strenuous [21] LOG check, you can even identify the the caster of that spell and recall other information about him. For example, you might recognize that a ring bears the markings of Ragnar the Munificient, renowned for his love of illusions, and that the ring you’ve discovered is one of his collection of invisibility rings.\r\n\r\nRetries. You cannot normally retry the check if you fail. You simply don’t have that information. You can retry if your chance of success improves—perhaps you use a library, or a high quality magnifying glass, which gives you a +1d6 equipment bonus to the check.",

          "Markdown": "# Dice Pools\n\n## Core Mechanic\n\nThe core resolution mechanic of the game is a dice pool based attribute check. Actions, including attacks, are performed by making attribute checks.  To make an attribute check, form a dice pool and attempt to beat a difficulty benchmark set by the GM.\n\n## Maximum Dice Pool\n\nThe maximum dice pool that a character can form is based on their grade.  A starting character can form a dice pool of up to 5d6. Additional grades add to this maximum pool size.\n\n| Grade | Max Dice Pool | \n| -------- | -------- | \n| 5 | 5d6 |\n| 6-7 | 6d6 |\n| 8-10 | 7d6 |\n| 11-14 | 8d6 |\n| 15-19 | 9d6 |\n| 20-25 | 10d6 |\n\n[Try the Dice Pool Calculator](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.enworld.org%2Ftools%2Fdicecalc.php&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Y1wx_RnaLH7vw6dbZ0YF6)\n\n## Attribute Checks\n\nDice pools are formed using attributes, skills, and equipment. You can only use one attribute pool, one skill pool, and one equipment pool.\n\nAdd the dice pool from an attribute plus any skill to form an attribute check.\n\nFor example, to climb a wall you might add 3d6 from AGILITY and 2d6 from climbing to form a 5d6 dice pool.\n\n| Attribute or Skill | Dice Pool | \n| -------- | -------- | \n| 1-2 | 1d6 |\n| 3-5  | 2d6 |\n| 6-9 | 3d6 |\n| 10-14 | 4d6 |\n| 15-20 | 5d6 |\n| 21-27 | 6d6 |\n| 28-35 | 7d6 |\n| 36-44 | 8d6 |\n| 45-54 | 9d6 |\n| 55-65 | 10d6 |\n| 66-77 | 11d6 |\n| 78-90 | 12d6 |\n| 91-104 | 13d6 |\n\n## Equipment\n\nEquipment quality contributes to the dice pool as follows.\n\nStandard equipment simply allows you to perform an action normally.  If basic equipment is not available, improvised equipment inflicts a -2d6 penalty.\n\nThe number of dice that equipment contributes to a dice pool can never exceed the number of dice tha skills contribute to it; you need a certain degree of expertise to fully benefit from higher quality equipment. If the equipment dice exceed the skill dice, reduce the equipment dice to equal the skill dice.\n\nThis includes armor (skill in light, medium, heavy, or powered), weapons (skills in swords, bows, rifles, staves, pistols, etc.), and general equipment for which an associated skill might be relevant (skill in meteorology when using ship's sensors to analyse an atmospheric fluctuation, for example).\n\n| Equipment Quality | Dice Pool | \n| -------- | -------- | \n| Improvised | -2d6 |\n| Standard | - |\n| High | +1d6 |\n| Exceptional  | +2d6 |\n| Mastercraft | +3d6 |\n| Artisanal | +4d6 |\n| Legendary  | +5d6 |\n\n## Group Checks\n\nWhen a group check is called for, every PC makes a check and the check succeeds if more PCs succeed than fail (i.e. half or more of the PCs succeed). It is assumed that stronger PCs are helping weaker ones, and weaker PCs are hindering stronger ones in a group check.\n\n## Aiding\n\nWhen characters aid one another, add together their base attributes and determine the resultant dice pool of the total. The GM will decide if, and how many characters can contribute - for example, only two people at a time might be able to break down a door.\n\nFor example, a character with STR 6 (3d6) aided by another character with STR 6 (3d6) combine to form an attribute of 12 (4d6).\n\n## Optional Rule: Gearmasters\n\nTo make the game more equipment focused rather than attribute and skill focused, in Cinematic Mode the dice pool maximum can optionally be applied only to attributes + skills. Gear quality may be added on top after capping, in the same way that exploits can. This changes the flavor of the game and makes the acquisition of high quality equipment a more central part. This will also increase dice pool sizes, and make characters generally more powerful.\n",

          "Markdown": "# Diseases\n\nFrom radiation sickness to alien viruses, illnesses can be debilitating without a trained doctor to treat them.\n\nIllnesses and disease all use a countdown pool, usually based on the victim's END attribute, although some are based on other attributes, including mental or psychic illneses based on WIL. Some stronger or weaker viruses and diseases may increase or decrease the start of the countdown pool. Most countdown pools require a check every day.\n\nA creature infected with any disease usually suffers one or more conditions until cured.\n\n## Catching a Disease\n\nTo be affected by a disease, a character is subjected to an attack against VITAL DEFENSE.  This could be as a result of a creature attack, or poison, or even an attack by the environment.  If the attack is successful, the character contracts the disease. Each disease mentions the basic method of transmission.\n\n## Treating Diseases\n\nTreating a disease requires a LOG check. This must be done at the same interval that the disease progresses – so if a disease requires daily dice pool rolls, the LOG check must be made daily. Of course, medical skills and facilities help enormously with the LOG check.\n\n**Curing.** If three successful checks in a row are made, with no failures in-between, the illness is cured.\n\n**Failure.**If the pool is depleted to zero, the victim permanently suffers the effect noted – often death.\n\n## Bubonic Plague (21)\n\nThis incredibly potent disease has, at times throughout history, wiped out entire thirds of populations. Any contact with an infected creature’s blood, saliva, or bodily fluid chances transmission of the disease (which, even with excellent care, has only a 50% survival rate). Victims suffer from gangrene of the extremities, chills, malaise, fever, muscle cramps, seizures, and swelling of the initial infection site, lymph glands, armpits, and groin.\n\nVictims are Sick while suffering this disease, and the end result is death.\n\n## Bacterial Pneumonia (13)\n\nThis sickness causes fever, rigors, coughing of blood, dyspnea, chest pains, and teeth chattering as fluid continually fills the victim’s lungs.\n\nVictims are Sick****while suffering this disease, and the end result is death.\n\n## Creeping Chills (16)\n\nThis illness causes dementia, leaving the victim unaware of the most basic facts about himself or those he knows.\n\nVictims are Forgetful****while suffering this disease, and the end result is permanent dementia.\n\n## Creeping Parasites (16)\n\nThese parasites affect the brain, its victims often displaying forgetfulness and amnesia, before eventual death.\n\nVictims are Forgetful****while suffering this disease, and the end result is death.\n\n## Devil Rot (21)\n\nA horrible disease caused by contact with devils and demons, the vicitm's flesh becomes hotter and hotter to the touch.\n\nWhile victims eventually spontaneously combust (causing death), in the meantime they gain SOAK 5 (heat/fire) and their touch does an additional 1d6 heat damage.\n\n## Dysentery (17)\n\nOne of the most common killers of soldiers throughout the 18th and 19th century, this disease is the result of poor sanitation and hygiene. Victims have drunk or eaten something with traces of feces from an already infected creature, generating cysts that travel through the digestive system before exploding in the intestines, where amoebas burrow into the organ’s walls and create abscesses or ulcers.\n\nVictims are Sick while suffering this disease, and the end result is death.\n\n## Flesh Rot (10)\n\nVictims of this unpleasant disease resemble zombies more than they do living people. Over a period of times, flesh turns rotten, and is slowly eaten away.  The stench is incredible, and the disease is incredibly painful. This disease is all the more dangerous because it is airborne.\n\nVictims are Sick while suffering this disease, and the end result is death.\n\n## Influenza (10)\n\nThe common flu is deceptively dangerous despite the effectiveness of vaccinations.\n\nVictims are Fatigued while suffering this disease, and the end result is death.\n\n## Hookworm (21)\n\nAlways take care to make sure that whatever water you find in the jungle, you clean it carefully—otherwise you may soon find yourself with a hookworm living in your intestines. There is no obvious immediate means to determine this infection has taken root aside from anemia and iron/protein-deficiency, and once the victim starts coughing, feeling chest pain, wheezing, and becomes feverish, they are suffering more from the hookworm’s larva than anything else.\n\nVictims are Sick while suffering this disease, and the end result is death.\n\n## Macrovirus (21)\n\nThis airborne illness is particularly dangerous because it reduces the victim's desire to actually do anything about it.  The illness causes extreme lethargy, worsening to the point where the victim will not eat, and simply wastes away.\n\nVictims are Fatigued while suffering this disease, and the end result is death.\n\n## Moor Plague (21)\n\nAn unplesant illness caused by scratches and cuts in foul swamps, this illness slowly turns the victim's skin green; additionally, the victim begins to emit the most unpleasant stench.\n\nVictims are Slowed****while suffering this disease, and the end result is death.\n\n## Orman's Syndrome (16)\n\nThis illness attacks the neural structures of the brain, gradually causing memory loss. By the time it reaches its conclusion, the victim loses all sense of identity and all long-term memories.  The victim will not recognize close friends or family members, or recall his own name, career, or skills.\n\nVictims are Forgetful while suffering this disease and the end result is complete, permanent amnesia.\n\n## Petrification (21)\n\nA rare disease, this bacteria hardens the victim's skin and organs until he or she reaches the consistency of stone. While suffering from the illness, the victim gains an additional SOAK 5 (all) for each dice removed from the dice pool, although he dies when the pool reaches zero.\n\nVictims are Slowed while suffering this disease, and are turned fully to stone as the end result..\n\n## Radiation Sickness (16)\n\nRadiation sickness is a painful, debilitating condition which ends in the victim’s death. Symptoms include vomiting, intestinal pain, bleeding, hair loss, and fever.\n\nVictims are Poisoned while suffering this disease, and the end result is death.\n\n## Retrograde Psychosis (16)\n\nThis is a severe condition of the mind which reduces the victim's mental age, eventually turning him into the equivalent of an infant.\n\nVictims are Confused while suffering this disease, and the end result is permanent infantalism.\n\n## Rigellian Fever (16)\n\nThis powerful virus causes extreme fever, sweating, and nausea, eventually resulting in the victim's death.\n\nVictims are Sick while suffering this disease, and the end result is death.\n\n## Salt Plague (21)\n\nThis unpleasant disease feeds on the victim's salt levels.  The victim eventually loses her humanity as her salt cravings become so intense that she becomes violent, seeking the salty blood of other victims.\n\n## Sepsis (16)\n\nExposure to infections and toxins through injury can have horrible effects on the body, greatly weakening creatures that have fallen ill to it.\n\nVictims are Fatigued while suffering this disease, and the end result is death.\n\n## Space Dementia (16)\n\nSpace dementia affects a small number of space travelers when they first encounter FTL speeds. It can be treated, but left alone it will result in memory loss, hallucinations, and madness.\n\nVictims are Confused****while suffering this disease, and the end result is permanent madness.\n\n## Syphilis (21)\n\nThough it is becoming less common in the developed world, this debilitating disease often makes its way to developed country from wayward port cities. Initially the disease causes lesions to appear on the contact areas of infection, but after four to ten weeks later this creates a rash that spreads to extremities causing wart-like growths that harbor more infectious bacteria as the victim begins to experience fever, sore throat, malaise, weight loss, hair loss, headaches, and inflammation of the joints, optic nerves, or organs. Later stages take hold 3 to 15 years after the initial sickness begins, causing tumor-like balls of inflammation that mutate and warp a victim’s features, giving them a -1d6 to all social checks.\n\nVictims are Poisoned while suffering this disease, and the end result is permanent mutation.\n\n## Tetanus (16)\n\nThis disease comes from infections borne on untreated wounds that can take only days or several months to take hold. The first sign is lockjaw, followed by facial spasms, stiffness of the neck, difficulty in swallowing, elevated blood pressure, and spasms for as long as four weeks. Recovery after this stage can take months and victims rarely recover fully.\n\nVictims are Poisoned while suffering this disease, and the end result is paralysis.\n\n## Tuberculosis (21)\n\nMost commonly found in the lungs, this disease causes fever, chills, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, and fatigue. Typically a person with TB never sees the slow-replicating bacteria proliferate across their body, but when the sickness stops being dormant it can quickly lay a victim low for months and months of recovery via antibiotic treatments.\n\nVictims are Poisoned while suffering this disease, and the end result is death.\n\n## Vampiris/Scarlet Malady (25)\n\nThis bacteria forces the victim to drink blood in order to survive. It also causes photo-sensitivity and lengthening of the canine teeth. An infected person needs to drink at least a pint of fresh blood every day, and loses 1 END attribute point for each day that the blood is not consumed. This illness is known both as Vampiris and Scarlet Malady.\n\n## Wailing Sickness (16)\n\nAn horrific disease which leaves its victims psychotic and insane, this illness is characterized by emotional outbursts, tempers, and, eventually, violence.\n\nVictims are Angry [****](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.woinrpg.com%2Fconditions&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw2JdGpkX5Koy1KY50Yam2QF)while suffering this disease, and the end result is permanent pychosis.\n\n## White Disease (21)\n\nThis illness is a form of leprosy.  It only affects those in their middle age or older, and results in the victim's painful death.\n\nVictims are Slowed while suffering this disease, and the end result is death.\n\n## White Fog (21)\n\nThis illness attacks the eyes of the patient, slowly eroding his vision.  Patients tend to see an increasingly opaque white fog obscuring their vision.\n\nVictims are Blind****while suffering this disease, and the end result is permanent blindness.\n\n## Wyrm Flu (16)\n\nSupposedly an illness originally suffered by great dragons, this injury-transmitted disease is often suffered by those who survive attacks by wyrms and similar creatures.\n\nVictims are Fatigued while suffering this disease, and the end result is death.\n\n## Zombie Fever (16)\n\nAs suggested by its name, this disease turns its victim into one of the undead, a mindless zombie hungry for living flesh. In the meantime, however, victims are Sick while suffering this disease.",

          "Markdown": "# Displacement Enhancements\r\n\r\nDisplace [element], [creature], or [self]\r\n\r\nDisplacement is the manipulation of time, space, and spirit. Through its use, creatures can teleport, time can be sped up, slowed, or even stopped, and different dimensions and planes can be accessed.\r\n\r\nA displacement cantrip can cause a slight blurring effect, granting +1 to Defense for up to one round.\r\n\r\n## Speed\r\n\r\nAccelerate. Cost 5 MP. Time for a specific creature is altered to accelerate its thoughts and actions. Each turn, affected creatures can take an extra action.\r\n\r\nPreternatural Celerity. Cost 10 MP. Each round for the duration, affected creatures can take two full rounds worth of actions.\r\n\r\nSpeed Flurry. Cost 4 MP. Once per turn, affected creatures can attack twice as a single action.\r\n\r\n## Time\r\n\r\nChronomancy (cost varies). These enhancements affect time.\r\n\r\nBurst of Time. Cost 15 MP. At any time during the spell’s duration, an affected creature may gain one free bonus round to act outside the normal flow of time. Only affected creatures can take actions in this free round. You cannot harm creatures, and spells you cast simply tick down their duration with no effect. You can move unattended objects, run away, or cast spells to affect yourself which will function normally. For each additional 2 MP you spend, affected creatures each gain another one round, which can be used at any time.\r\n\r\nDilated Time. Cost 3 MP. All creatures, objects, and spell effects in the area age one round. Their effects still occur, so an ongoing spell deals damage for the round, a fire burns one round worth of fuel, and poison runs its course one round faster. Likewise, a spell will end one round sooner. For spells that grant an attribute check to resist on a round by round basis, use the result of the lastmade check to determine effects. Things within the area of effect cannot influence those outside, so if a dilated fuse sets off a bomb in the area, the explosion will be limited to the area of effect. Unwilling creatures in the area of effect must be subject to an attack vs. Mental Defense or they are unaffected. For 6 MP, things age 5 rounds; for 10 MP they age 5 minutes; and for 15 MP they age half a day.\r\n\r\nGrow Plant. Cost 1 MP. Non-sentient plants in the area of effect age one day. You can purchase this enhancement multiple times. This effect is natural growth, and is not undone when the spell’s duration ends. Indeed, the spell’s duration doesn’t matter for this effect.\r\n\r\nPocket of Time. Cost 15 MP. The area of effect and everything inside it gain extra time, equal to the spell’s duration. The outside world stands still while the area of effect speeds along. Anything leaving the area of effect loses the effect of this extra time, and returns to the normal flow of time just slightly outside the area. Spell effects created during this time pocket do not continue after this spell ends, so it is useful for resting and healing, but not for actual offense or defense. Unwilling creatures in the area of effect must be subject to an attack vs. Mental Defense. If unsuccessful, they are shunted to outside the area of effect.\r\n\r\nSlow Time. Cost varies. You inflict the Slowed condition. The standard condition costs 2 MP, while the extreme condition costs 4 MP. The condition is a temporary one which can be shaken off normally; however, you can make it persistent by doubling this enhancement’s MP cost.\r\n\r\nTime Hop. Cost 4 MP per round. The Time Hop enhancement lets you skip forward in time 1 round per 4 MP spent. Traveling backward in time is impossible by default; meddling with history is only available in campaigns where the GM wants to introduce the possibility. One time during the spell’s duration, affected creatures can time hop once, using two actions to do so. When a creature time hops, it vanishes, then reappears in the same place after the allotted time passes. For the creature, the transition is instantaneous. If the creature would reappear in a solid object, it instead is shunted to the nearest suitably large open space and takes 2d6 blunt damage.\r\n\r\nTimeless. Cost 15 MP. The area of effect is removed from time for the spell’s duration. Nothing inside the area of effect changes or can be affected.\r\n\r\n## Phasing\r\n\r\nGhost Touch. Cost 1 MP. The attack can harm incorporeal creatures as easily as corporeal ones. If used on a creature, the creature gains the benefits to natural attacks and attacks made without weapons, including spell attacks. If used on an object or weapon, the object grants the benefit to all attacks made with it.\r\n\r\nPhasing Attack. Cost 3 MP. The attack selectively passes through certain types of matter harmlessly, and it only hurts those you want to strike. It ignores armor and shield Soak values, and deals damage normally. If used on a creature, the creature gains the benefits to natural attacks and attacks made without weapons, including spell attacks. If used on an object or weapon, the object grants the benefit to all attacks made with it.\r\n\r\nPhasing Movement. Cost 9 MP. This allows you to move through any sort of solid objects as easily as through air, but you are not ethereal and can still be harmed by attacks normally. While traveling through these materials, you can choose to move across any part of the material as if it were solid, allowing you to walk across mud, or climb upward or downward through stone at up to 45 degree angles. You can move at up to half your base speed through solid objects. You still cannot breathe while inside a solid object.\r\n\r\n## Projection\r\n\r\nSpirit Wander. Cost 1 MP. Spirit Wander simply lets the creature release its spirit from its body. The spirit can travel at the creature’s base speed, vaguely observing the world around it as if through a thin curtain. It can sense the presence, number, and general size of all creatures present, but it can only see clearly or communicate with other spirit wanderers and can in no way influence the real world. The distance the spirit can travel from its body is the same as the normal range of the spell. The creature is aware vaguely of the state of its real body, and can return at any time by using two actions.\r\n\r\nPossession. Cost 5 MP. The Possession enhancement allows you (or the affected creature) to move its soul into the body of another. First, your (or the creature’s) spirit must leave its own body. You may then choose to enter some sort of receptacle, generally called a “magic jar.” With two actions you can try to possess any living creature your spirit touches, or that is within range of the magic jar. You make a MAG vs. Mental Defense attack, and if you fail, your spirit stays out of its body, and each successive attempt to enter that creature takes a –1d6 die penalty. If the attack succeeds, your spirit enters its body. If you used a magic jar, the creature’s soul is trapped in the jar, but otherwise, its spirit automatically enters your own body. A magic jar costs at least 100 gc to purchase or make. Alternatively, your own body can be the magic jar, in which case your spirits switch places.\r\n\r\nWhile in the body of another, you can freely move beyond the normal range of the spell. When the spell ends, your spirit leaves the host and tries to return to its own body, and the host’s soul returns to its body. However, you cannot leave the host if neither your original body nor the magic jar is within range. If the spell ends and you cannot reach your original body, you die. This likewise happens to the soul of the host if its body is out of range when the spell ends.\r\n\r\nIf either body dies during the spell, both souls must make a Difficult [16] WIL check or die. If both succeed, whoever rolled highest gains permanent possession of the remaining body. If one fails, the other gains possession. If both fail, the remaining body simply dies.\r\n\r\nIf the spell is made permanent before its duration ends, however, the souls become comfortable residents of their current locations.\r\n\r\nProjection. Cost 3 MP. The Projection enhancement allows you to send your soul out of your body yet still influence the real world. Your spirit is visible and has all the same qualities as your real body, except that by spending two actions you can return to simply a spirit state, unseen and intangible. Also with two actions you can return to your body. You still cannot move beyond the spell’s normal range. If your spirit body is slain, your spirit returns to your body and are reduced to 0 Health. If this spell is combined with a teleport spell, the range you can roam is determined from the point you teleport to.\r\n\r\n## Teleportation\r\n\r\nTeleport. Cost 5 MP. One time in the spell’s duration, the affected creature can teleport up to anywhere within spell’s area. This requires two actions. A creature that teleports can bring along any objects it carries.\r\n\r\nIf you teleport to somewhere out of your line of sight, you must make a LOG check (see the table below). If you fail, you end up off course by d66% of the distance traveled.\r\n\r\nAt-Will Teleport. Cost 9 MP. For an extra 9 MP on top of your Teleport effect, you can get the At Will enhancement. This gives you the ability to activate the teleport as many times as you want during the spell’s duration. If you individually target this spell, the affected creature or creatures can teleport independently. Each teleportation takes just a single action.\r\n\r\n### Teleport Difficulty\r\n\r\nFamiliarity with Destination\t\tDifficulty\r\n\r\nFamiliar\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoutine [10]\r\n\r\nSeen\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDifficult [16]\r\n\r\nDescription only\t\t\t\t\t\tStrenuous [21]",

          "Markdown": "# Divination Enhancements\r\n\r\nDivine [element], [creature], or [virtue]\r\n\r\nDivinations allow the magic-user to discover information, detect objects, view distant locations, to see things normally unseen, and to let her spells reach extreme distances. When you successfully divine something, a vision of the location appears in the mind of the target or targets of the spell (usually just you). You might see the image appear in a pool of water or a crystal ball, but only those affected by this spell can see the image. If you fail the MAG check, you see nothing.\r\n\r\nNormally, since you receive the visions directly, you do not need to buy range or area of effect enhancements for divinations. If you do, however, any creature in the area of effect sees the same vision that you would. If you are not in the area of effect of your own spell, you yourself do not see anything from the divination. Duration functions normally.\r\n\r\nYou can attach a “rider” spell to a scrying attempt, effectively sending a spell at long distance. The rider spell costs double the amount it normally would.\r\n\r\nTo make an area rather than a specific creature or object the target of your scrying, you need to use the secret of space.\r\n\r\nA divination cantrip can read tea leaves, throw bones, do a tarot reading, or other divination implements, to answer a single yes/no question, but this can only be done once per day. Alternatively, it can be used to detect the presence of (but not the exact location or details of) a creature, element, or virtue within 5’.\r\n\r\n## Clairvoyance\r\n\r\nClairvoyance. Cost 5 MP. The most common use of a divination is to spy on a distant creature, object, or location. To spy on a creature, you make a Magic check, opposed by the target’s Mental Defense. You must have seen the target before. If your MAG check is successful, you can see the immediate surroundings of your target, about a 20' radius (so gigantic creatures may take up all of your view). Your target gets an INT check (opposed by your casting check) to notice that he is being scried upon.\r\n\r\nTo be able to hear or use other senses through the divination, or to expand the field of view, requires extra enhancements. To spy on an area or object, make a Challenging [13] MAG check. If you have special vision (darksight, truesight, omnisight), these work normally. This can be combined with Clairaudience. You can also move your viewpoint with telekinesis; the “sensor” counts as a tiny object (1 MP, Speed 5) and requires the movement skill.\r\n\r\nClairaudience. Cost 2 MP. As Clairvoyance, but you hear sounds instead of seeing the target. Sounds from beyond the 20' radius are muffled and unclear. This can be combined with Clairvoyance.\r\n\r\nDiscreet View. Cost 2 MP per die. You can make your scrying harder to notice. You gain +1d6 per 2 MP to the second roll when remote viewing.\r\n\r\nExpanded View. Cost 1 MP per 10' radius. Increase the radius of a Clairvoyance field of view by 10'. You can choose this enhancement multiple times.\r\n\r\n## Comprehenion\r\n\r\nComprehension. Cost 1 MP. Choose one language. Affected creatures understand and can read that language. This can also enable semi-sentient creatures to understand a language in order to convey simple commands. For an additional 1 MP, affected creatures can write in the chosen languages.\r\n\r\nComprehension, Full. Cost 3 MP. Affected creatures understand and can read any language. For an additional 1 MP, affected creatures can write in any language.\r\n\r\nDecode. Cost 5 MP. Affected creatures can decipher encrypted text or speech in code.\r\n\r\n## Vision\r\n\r\nDarksight. Cost 1 MP. You or the target gains darksight to the spell’s range for the duration of the spell.\r\n\r\nTruesight. Cost 2 MP. You or the target gains truesight to the spell’s range for the duration of the spell, enabling the creature to see invisible creatures, through illusions, and through disguises.\r\n\r\nX-ray Sight. Cost 5 MP. Affected creatures can see through solid objects within the selected range. Darkness still provides concealment, but objects, fog, etc. do not. The creature can choose which objects it wants to see through, such as if it wants to be able to shield itself from a medusa hiding behind a rock.\r\n\r\n## Detection\r\n\r\nDowsing. Cost 1 MP. Dowsing is basic detection and location: you determine the direction to the nearest significant quantity of the selected secret. If there are several different things of the chosen type within the area of effect, you are aware of roughly how many there are, and can concentrate on each one by one to determine its location.\r\n\r\nDowsing, Specific. Cost 3 MP. As Dowsing, except you choose a specific object or creature you would be able to identify if you saw it, and you sense the direction to it.\r\n\r\n## Information\r\n\r\nHistory Reading. Cost 5 MP. If you have a creature or object available, you can use this ability to see an overview of the history of the subject. When you make this divination, choose a span of time in history you want to read through. The shorter the span of time, the more specific the details are, and the longer the span, the more general. If you do a reading for a sword’s history in the past week, you will see what battles it has been used in, and who it has killed, but if you try to read the past hundred years on it, you will likely just learn the vague identities of its owners. Using the secret of magic, this enhancement can be used to identify a magical item: name, effects, and methods of activation.\r\n\r\nOracle. Cost 2 MP. Questions are asked of an entity, whether local or extraplanar. You can ask a nearby tree or a bird, or you can try to contact distant planar entities. You cannot ask the same question through a divination in the same 24 hour period. You receive a short answer to your question. If the question is direct, you will likely receive a simple “yes,” “no,” or “neither” answer. If the question is complex, the answer will be cryptic. The question must relate to the present (within a minute); to ask questions about the past or the future, an additional 2 MP must be spent, and to ask questions about the distant past or future, an additional 5 MP must be spent.",

          "Markdown": "# Enchantment Enhancements\r\n\r\nEnchant [creature]\r\n\r\nEnchantment spells alter the moods and emotions of creatures, making them more likely to perform certain actions. Unlike compulsions, enchantments cannot force a character to perform more than primitive actions; at best, an enchantment might put a creature to sleep or make it attack in a frenzied anger.\r\n\r\nThe affected creatures’ minds are altered slightly. They are influenced by the spell you cast, but generally they are still free to act as appropriate to their (now slightly altered) nature. You have no actual control over enchanted creatures; however, if you instill in them friendly or helpful attitudes, you can influence them much more easily.\r\n\r\nEnchantment spells inflict or remove mental conditions. Each round, creatures affected by condition shake it off as normal for a condition. However, if you choose the Subtle Enchantment enhancement, creatures cannot try to shake it off each round because they do not realize they have been enchanted.\r\n\r\nAn enchantment cantrip can make a target feel a very weak emotion for up to one round.\r\n\r\nEnchantment spells affect the following conditions: Afraid, Angry, Charmed, Confused, Manic, Sleeping.\r\n\r\n## Charm\r\n\r\nCharm. Cost varies. You inflict the Afraid, Angry, Charmed, Confused, Manic, or Sleeping condition. The standard condition costs 2 MP, while the extreme condition costs 4 MP. The condition is a temporary one which can be shaken off normally; however, you can make it persistent by doubling this enhancement’s MP cost.\r\n\r\nSubtle Enchantment. Cost 3 MP. The creature is unaware it has been enchanted, and cannot shake off the charm, which lasts for a set duration (which must be purchased). The target’s allies may still attempt to remove the condition. If the spell also contains compulsion enhancements, this enhancement also functions as the Subtle Compulsion enhancement. You do not need to buy both enhancements. Without this enhancement, charmed creatures will be aware that they are being affected.\r\n\r\nTargeted Enchantment. Cost 1 MP. You may designate the focus of an enchanted creature’s emotions as another creature within range. For example, a love spell would normally make the target love the caster; instead you can make the target love a third party. This also goes for anger, fear, and so on.",

          "Markdown": "# Cybernetics\r\n\r\nThe science of cybernetics is the alteration of organic creatures with artificial parts. These parts can be electronic, bio electronic, or mechanical in nature.\r\n\r\nCybernetic modifications can enhance or improve natural capabilities, compensate for injuries, or grant entirely new capabilities. Anything from an artificial arm to retinal targeting implants to reinforced skin can be accomplished through the science of cybernetics. Even the mind can be altered, with improved cognitive functionality or extended data storage and memory.\r\n\r\n## Organic Limitations\r\n\r\nA player-character or creature cannot continue adding cybernetic modifications indefinitely. The body can only take so much foreign matter before it starts to reject it. The number of cybernetic modifications allowed is equal to the subject’s ENDURANCE attribute. Some cybernetic modifications increase ENDURANCE. In these cases, the original (unmodified) attribute is used to determine the limit of cybernetic alterations.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of calculating this limit, a minor alteration counts as one modification, and a major alteration counts as two alterations.\r\n\r\nA creature which has fully allocated its available cybernetic allowance changes its type to mechanoid. A mechanoid creature is vulnerable (1d6) to electricity damage and (2d6) to ion damage. Ion damage is specially designed to attack electronics and mechanoids.\r\n\r\nEnhancement \t\t\t\t\tType \t\tCost (cr) \t\tEffect\r\n\r\nArtificial arm \t\t\t\t\t\tMajor \t\t100,000 \t\t+1d6 to STRENGTH dice pool\r\n\r\nArtificial leg \t\t\t\t\t\tMajor \t\t125,000 \t\t+1d6 to AGILITY dice pool\r\n\r\nDigiclaws \t\t\t\t\t\t\tMinor \t\t100,000 \t\t+1d6 natural damage\r\n\r\nDurarmor/sub-dermal plating \tMajor \t\t200,000 \t\tSOAK 5\r\n\r\nDuraskin \t\t\t\t\t\t\tMajor \t\t50,000 \t\tSOAK 2, SOAK 5 (fire)\r\n\r\nExosuit, partial \t\t\t\t\tMajor \t\t75,000 \t\t+1d6 to STRENGTH dice pool\r\n\r\nExosuit, full \t\t\t\t\t\tMajor \t\t175,000 \t\t+1d6 to STRENGTH, +1d6 to AGILITY\r\n\r\nHormonal regulators \t\t\tMinor \t\t30,000 \t\t+1d6 to social interactions three times per day\r\n\r\nInjector implant \t\t\t\t\tMinor \t\t18,000 \t\tOne drug type, injects as a free action\r\n\r\nInput jacks \t\t\t\t\t\tMinor \t\t50,000 \t\t+1d6 to computer operations\r\n\r\nMemory chip \t\t\t\t\t\tMinor \t\t25,000 \t\t+1d6 to LOG dice pool\r\n\r\nOlfactory sensors \t\t\t\tMinor \t\t25,000 \t\t+1d6 to smell-based INT checks\r\n\r\nPsionic scrambler \t\t\t\tMinor \t\t50,000 \t\t+5 MENTAL DEFENSE\r\n\r\nRetinal implant \t\t\t\t\tMinor \t\t15,000 \t\tNight, telescopic, magnifying, infra-red\r\n\r\nSkeletal reinforcement \t\t\tMajor \t\t110,000\t\t+1d6 to ENDURANCE dice pool\r\n\r\nSkill implant\t\t\t\t\t\tMinor \t\t15,000 \t\t1 new skill at 1d6\r\n\r\nStatic dynamo \t\t\t\t\tMajor \t\t50,000 \t\tDischarge energy as an attack\r\n\r\nWeapon integration \t\t\t\tMajor \t\t50,000 \t\tPlus price of weapon\r\n\r\nVoice synthesizer \t\t\t\tMinor \t\t25,000 \t\t-\r\n\r\nWavelength receiver \t\t\tMinor \t\t50,000 \t\tSense/read/hear energy/radiation wavelengths\r\n\r\nArtificial Limbs. Artificial arms and legs interface directly with nerves and work exactly like a regular limb – albeit stronger and faster. Arms add to STRENGTH, and legs increase AGILITY (cumulatively, so a full set of four limbs adds +2d6 STR and +2d6 AGI).\r\n\r\nDigiclaws. These sharp metal talons are hidden within the fingertips and release or detract as a reaction. A creature with digiclaws increases its natural damage by +1d6 and may inflict slashing or piercing damage. Characters or creatures with natural claws (including felans) cannot benefit from this enhancement.\r\n\r\nDurarmor/sub-dermal plating. Durarmor is a more substantial, advanced form of duraskin - an actual layer of armor under the skin. Flexible layers of resilient duranium increase a character’s natural SOAK by 5.\r\n\r\nDuraskin. Duraskin is a skin transplant. The material is tougher than regular skin, as well as being fairly fireproof. It has a slight yellow tinge, however.\r\n\r\nExosuit. Exosuits are old-fashioned, almost primitive forms of cybernetics. They consist of frameworks on the outside of the body which tap directly in to the wearer’s nervous system, almost like an integrated suit of power armor. A partial exosuit covers just the upper half of the body, while a full exosuit includes the legs.\r\n\r\nHormonal Regulators. A character with hormonal regulators is able to expel gathered hormones of various types for the appropriate situation. Three timesper day the character may add +1d6 to a social attribute check with another living creature.\r\n\r\nInjector Implants. An injector implant stores a chemical or drug for rapid deployment as a free action. The implant stores three uses of the drug before it needs to be refilled.\r\n\r\nInput Jacks. These attachments allow you to interface with any electronic system (so long as it has an output), granting a +1d6 bonus to computer operations and cracking checks.\r\n\r\nMemory Chip. Memory chips increase a characters LOG attribute. Multiple chips can be implanted, which work cumulatively, but every two chips reduces the character’s WIL dice pool by 1d6 as their sense of self is gradually eroded. Skill implants count towards this total.\r\n\r\nOlfactory Sensors. This cybernetic alteration laces the character’s nasal cavities with a mesh of metal that vastly increases its sense of smell, granting a +1d6 bonus to relevant checks (if the creature already has a scent-based bonus, this is cumulative).\r\n\r\nPsionic Scrambler. This crude cranial implant helps protect the user against psionic attacks. However, someone with this implant automatically has a PSI attribute of 0.\r\n\r\nRetinal Implants. These implants grant permanent powers of enhanced vision. A basic implant grants one ability from the list below (a character can have a different implant in each eye). More advanced implants offer multiple abilities in one device at the cost of the total value of each ability separately multiplied by the number of abilities.\r\n\r\nNight vision This enables the user to see in darkness for 60’. Grants an environmental die in darkness or lowlight.\r\n\r\nTelescopic This doubles the user’s visual range and increases range increments on weapons by 50%.\r\n\r\nMagnifying This enables the user to see tiny details, increasing the chance to spot clues by a +1d6 bonus.\r\n\r\nInfra-red This is a little like night vision, but has a longer range and only reveals objects or creatures which give off heat. Grants an environmental die in darkness, but not low-light.\r\n\r\nSkeletal Reinforcement. This lengthy and painful procedure fortifies a character’s entire skeleton, bracing bones with layers of duranium. The over result is that the character’s stamina is increased overall, as well as the ability to withstand physical damage.\r\n\r\nSkill Implant. A chip similar to the memory chip, a skill implant gives a character a brand new skill. Implants only grant a basic level of proficiency in the skill. Multiple chips can be implanted, with different skills, but every two chips reduces the character’s WIL dice pool by 1d6 as his sense of self is gradually eroded. Memory chips count towards this total.\r\n\r\nStatic Dynamo. A character with this modification is capable of storing up an impressive charge of energy. Three times per day when hit with a melee attack, they may release some of this energy on their attacker, dealing an amount of damage equal to the character’s total number of career grades.\r\n\r\nWeapon Integration. A character with an existing cybernetic limb can have a weapon integrated into it. The weapon operates as normal, but cannot be dropped or disarmed. The weapon must be two size categories smaller than the character, and must be paid for in addition to the integration.\r\n\r\nVoice Synthesizer. A voice synthesizer enables a character to use fake voices. When doing so, the character gains a +1d6 bonus to CHA checks made to deceive others.\r\n\r\nWavelength Receiver. This implant affects the cerebral cortex, causing it to generate complex organic structures in the vision center of the brain that allow a creature to perceive wavelengths of energy. As a reaction a creature with a wavelength receiver can tune it to detect magnetic, radio, cellphone, radar, or even chi (and any other type of energy field the GM sees fit).",

They are used legally by medical professionals and illegally by others who seek to gain an advantage.\r\n\r\n## Addiction\r\n\r\nEvery drug and concoction has an addiction class. Each time the drug is taken, the user must make a WIL check to avoid becoming addicted. The WIL check increases by 1 each time the drug is used.\r\n\r\nAn addicted character suffers a side-effect every day that he or she does not use the addictive substance. The effect begins when the character wakes that day, and continues unless the substance is used. If the substance is used, the side-effect goes away until the next morning. The side effect can be randomly determined (see below) or assigned to the drug.\r\n\r\nRemoving an addition requires a character to refrain from use of a drug for the time indicated below (suffering the side effect for that period of time).\r\n\r\nAddiction Class \tDescription \t\t\t\t\t\tWIL Check \t\t\tRemove Addiction\r\n\r\nI \t\t\t\tNon-addictive \t\t\t\t\t- \t\t\t\t\t\t-\r\n\r\nII \t\t\t\tAddictive; caution required \t\tChallenging [13] \t\t1 day\r\n\r\nIII \t\t\t\tHighly addictive \t\t\t\t\tDifficult [16] \t\t\t1 week\r\n\r\nIV \t\t\t\tInstantly addictive \t\t\t\tDemanding [21] \t\t1 month\r\n\r\n## Side Effects\r\n\r\nSome chemicals are noted as having side-effects.

Amnesia drugs are used to remove memories. Developed for trauma victims to help them forget certain events, less beneficial uses were soon found. The user gets a Difficult [16] WIL check; on a failure, the last day’s event’s are forgotten. There is a risk that more will be lost: roll 1d6, and on a roll of 6 the user loses one skill rank from a random skill.\r\n\r\nAntiagiatics. Aging is a trivial obstacle in the far future. Anti-aging drugs exist in infinite varieties and brands. These drugs are taken monthly, and each application effectively reduces the user’s age by 1d6 years. However, they are slightly addictive. If an application is missed, the user ages 3d6 years (but will not age beyond his actual, natural age). Brands include Gerasite, and YungAgen.\r\n\r\nAntidote. Antidotes work to counteract slow-acting toxins. They grant a bonus die to a poison dice pool.\r\n\r\nAnti-addiction. With the prevalence of addiction, it was only a matter of time before a drug to counteract that very thing was developed. The unfortunate side effect is that the drug is mildly addictive itself, which means it only gets prescribed for addiction classes III and IV. Taking the drug reduces an addition difficulty value of a particular addiction by 1 point. The drug only works once per day.\r\n\r\nBoosters, street. Boosters are a basic, cheap drug which grants the user a temporary burst of strength, stamina, or even intelligence. The word “booster” is merely slang for an enormously wide range of chemicals – adrenaline shots, neural exciters, smart drugs, stimulants, performance enhancers, and more. A booster gives the user a +1d6 bonus to an attribute for one hour. Boosters do not stack with each other – taking two does not increase the bonus to +2d6. Boosters typically have street names like Azrael, Berzerk, Brilliance, Candy, Drive, Hype, Nectar, Snap, Stims, Venom, or Whiz.\r\n\r\nBoosters, strong. Strong boosters are rare, expensive and addictive. They grant a +2d6 bonus to an attribute, but for five minutes only, and that same attribute suffers a -2d6 penalty for an hour thereafter,\r\n\r\nBoosters, ultra. Ultraboosters are a class of very rare, often experimental drugs which frequently have some form of side effect (roll once on the side-effects table). They are highly addictive, extremely expensive, and grant a +3d6 bonus to an attribute for one hour, but that same attribute suffers a -3d6 penalty for six hours thereafter.\r\n\r\nHealJel. An antibiotic jelly which can treat small injuries. Application of HealJel cures 1 point of HEALTH. However, a person can only benefit from it once per day. HealJel is a common brand name, but there are many more – Medi-Gel and JelAid are two other well-known ones.\r\n\r\nImmunity booster. Immunity boosters are used as preventative drugs; they increase the user’s resistance to disease. An immunity booster gives the user a 2d6 bonus to disease dice pools for one day.\r\n\r\nMetabolic depressor. Metabolic depressors slow the metabolism and life signs for one hour. One application can be enough to hide from scans, inflicting a 2-dice penalty to the detection difficulty. The common street name for metabolic depressors (which can be used for criminal infiltration activities) is Zombie.\r\n\r\nMetabolism stopper. An extremely potent form of metabolic depressor, this injection completely halts metabolism and life signs for 4 hours. The user is completely invisible to scans and detection equipment, and appears dead to a cursory visual inspection. The user is unconscious during this time.\r\n\r\nMood enhancers. These common drugs are used to create a feeling of well-being or happiness for four hours. They are used recreationally by many, and are easily available, though mildly addictive. The most common versions are Okay, Glee, Equinox, The Eucharist, and Allswell.\r\n\r\nOxygenation. Injections such as Tri- Ox can enable a creature to operate normally in a zero oxygen environment for 5 minutes, or a low-oxygen environment for one hour.\r\n\r\nPain relief. Painkillers can be used to grant temporary HEALTH – however, the effects wear off, and the temporary HEALTH wears off at the same time. A basic pain relief pill grants 1d6 temporary HEALTH for one hour.\r\n\r\nPain relief, strong. Extremely strong painkillers work much like regular ones. They are more expensive, and more addictive, but give a temporary 2d6 boost to HEALTH for one hour.\r\n\r\nReaction enhancers. These increase cognitive processing, awareness, and reaction speed. They add 1d6 to INITIATIVE checks for one hour, and are mildly addictive. The most famous brand is Flash.\r\n\r\nRegenerative. Regeneratives are a powerful form of drug which endow the user with rapid healing. The drug increases daily natural healing by 3d6 HEALTH for the day it is used.\r\n\r\nSurvival compounds. These pills ward off the need for food and water for 24 hours. They are highly addictive, but are fortunately so much more expensive than actual food and water that they never became a societal problem.\r\n\r\nTranquilizer. Tranquilizers are used to put a patient (or victim) to sleep. These are used by hunters, police, and also by customers who have trouble with insomnia. The imbiber makes a Difficult [16] END check or falls asleep for 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nTruth drugs. Truth drugs compel the imbiber to talk truthfully. In reality, they’re not a guarantee – the user can resist with a Difficult [16] WIL check. The drug wears off after just 20 minutes. Brand names include Diathol, Tellit, and Tell-all.\r\n\r\n## Creating Drugs\r\n\r\nOne dose of a drug can created by performing a major chemistry science with a difficulty equal to 20 + one percent of the drug's value. Such a drug is unlicensed, cannot be legally sold, and spoils after one day.",

          "Markdown": "# Herbs\r\n\r\nHerbs and other ingredients found in the wild have long been a staple part of the healer’s toolkit. Indeed, herbalism is linked not just with healing, but also with protection, witchcraft, and—of course—poison. Whether applied as a poultice, infused as a incense, drank as a soup or tea, nature’s power over the world is undeniable, especially when applied by those skilled in its use.\r\n\r\nHerbs have predefined uses; herbalism is a practice of following specific recipes.\r\n\r\nHerbalism differs from alchemy in that the former is based on existing herbal properties and recipes, while the latter uses more exotic ingredients to create magic. This section lists a range of herbs and their uses.\r\n\r\nAnybody can perform herbalism, but those with strong LOG attributes and ranks in the herbalism skill will find it much easier.\r\n\r\nHerb \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUsage \t\t\t\t\t\tCost (gc) \t\t\tPreparation \t\t\t\tDifficulty \t\t\t\tAlternate Skills\r\n\r\nAbyssal bloom \t\t\t\t\tHappiness \t\t\t\t10 \t\t\t\t\tGum \t\t\t\t\t\tChallenging [13] \t\t—\r\n\r\nAcorn of the pipemold flower\tHealing \t\t\t\t\t100 \t\t\t\tSwallowed \t\t\t\tDifficult [16] \t\t\tmedicine\r\n\r\nAlfalfa \t\t\t\t\t\t\tGood fortune \t\t\t500 \t\t\t\tLeaf \t\t\t\t\t\tDemanding [21] \t\t—\r\n\r\nAngelica \t\t\t\t\t\t\tProtection from spirits \t250 \t\t\t\tIncense \t\t\t\t\tDemanding [21] \t\treligion, abjuration\r\n\r\nBittervine \t\t\t\t\t\tPain relief \t\t\t\t30 \t\t\t\t\tCompress \t\t\t\tDifficult [16] \t\t\tmedicine\r\n\r\nBlessed bean \t\t\t\t\t\tProtection from evil \t\t100 \t\t\t\tSoup \t\t\t\t\t\tDifficult [16] \t\t\tabjuration\r\n\r\nBulb of the goldbark bud \t\tConcentration \t\t\t75 \t\t\t\t\tChewed \t\t\t\t\tChallenging [13] \t\tAny [magical]\r\n\r\nChamomile \t\t\t\t\t\tSleep \t\t\t\t\t\t250 \t\t\t\tPotion \t\t\t\t\tDemanding [21] \t\t—\r\n\r\nDarkberry \t\t\t\t\t\tDarksight \t\t\t\t\t100 \t\t\t\tTea \t\t\t\t\t\tDifficult [16] \t\t\tmining\r\n\r\nDeath seed \t\t\t\t\t\tAdrenaline \t\t\t\t100 \t\t\t\tRaw \t\t\t\t\t\tDifficult [16] \t\t\t—\r\n\r\nDevil’s berry \t\t\t\t\t\tStrong pain relief \t\t50 \t\t\t\t\tSalve \t\t\t\t\t\tDifficult [16] \t\t\tmedicine\r\n\r\nElder bean \t\t\t\t\t\tAntidote \t\t\t\t\t50 \t\t\t\t\tTea \t\t\t\t\t\tChallenging [13] \t\tmedicine\r\n\r\nFiredrake petals \t\t\t\t\tFire protection \t\t\t200 \t\t\t\tOintment \t\t\t\t\tDifficult [16] \t\t\tabjuration\r\n\r\nGarlic \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRepel vampires \t\t\t250 \t\t\t\tWorn \t\t\t\t\t\tDemanding [21] \t\treligion\r\n\r\nGilly flower \t\t\t\t\t\tMagic resistance \t\t\t500 \t\t\t\tSmoked \t\t\t\t\tDemanding [21] \t\tabjuration\r\n\r\nHorsebloom \t\t\t\t\t\tDisease resistance \t\t50 \t\t\t\t\tSmoked \t\t\t\t\tChallenging [13] \t\t—\r\n\r\nLotus nut \t\t\t\t\t\t\tRemove memories \t\t500 \t\t\t\tNut \t\t\t\t\t\tDemanding [21] \t\tenchantment\r\n\r\nMarjoram \t\t\t\t\t\tEase sickness \t\t\t\t250 \t\t\t\tTea \t\t\t\t\t\tDemanding [21] \t\tmedicine\r\n\r\nMistletoe \t\t\t\t\t\t\tEnhance nature magic \t100 \t\t\t\tWorn \t\t\t\t\t\tDifficult [16] \t\t\t—\r\n\r\nPepper foil \t\t\t\t\t\tOxygenation \t\t\t\t75 \t\t\t\t\tPaste \t\t\t\t\t\tChallenging [13] \t\t—\r\n\r\nPipe grass \t\t\t\t\t\tTranquilizer \t\t\t\t100 \t\t\t\tOil \t\t\t\t\t\tDifficult [16] \t\t\t—\r\n\r\nQueen’s orchid \t\t\t\t\tAdrenaline \t\t\t\t30 \t\t\t\t\tIncense \t\t\t\t\tChallenging [13] \t\t—\r\n\r\nSilver garlic \t\t\t\t\t\tProtection from undead \t500 \t\t\t\tWorn \t\t\t\t\t\tDemanding [21] \t\treligion, abjuration\r\n\r\nSpiderbulb \t\t\t\t\t\tSight \t\t\t\t\t\t100 \t\t\t\tUnder tongue \t\t\tDifficult [16] \t\t\t—\r\n\r\nSpirit petal \t\t\t\t\t\tFake death \t\t\t\t1,000 \t\t\t\tPowder \t\t\t\t\tStrenuous [25] \t\t—\r\n\r\nSticky graysap \t\t\t\t\tStops bleeding \t\t\t100 \t\t\t\tPaste \t\t\t\t\t\tDifficult [16] \t\t\tmedicine\r\n\r\nStinkfruit \t\t\t\t\t\t\tWard off hunger\t\t\t250 \t\t\t\tEaten \t\t\t\t\t\tDemanding [21] \t\t—\r\n\r\nSwamp slime \t\t\t\t\t\tCures blindness \t\t\t250 \t\t\t\tSmeared \t\t\t\t\tDemanding [21] \t\t—\r\n\r\nTanglethorn \t\t\t\t\t\tMild antibiotic \t\t\t5 \t\t\t\t\tJelly \t\t\t\t\t\tChallenging [13] \t\tmedicine\r\n\r\nThunder flower \t\t\t\t\tTruth drug \t\t\t\t250 \t\t\t\tTea \t\t\t\t\t\tDemanding [21] \t\t—\r\n\r\nViolet mold \t\t\t\t\t\tQuick reactions \t\t\t100 \t\t\t\tBrewed \t\t\t\t\tDifficult [16] \t\t\t—\r\n\r\nWhistling vine \t\t\t\t\tYouth \t\t\t\t\t\t1,000 \t\t\t\tOintment \t\t\t\t\tStrenuous [25] \t\t—\r\n\r\nYellow bark \t\t\t\t\t\tCures madness\t \t\t250 \t\t\t\tIncense \t\t\t\t\tDemanding [21] \t\tmedicine\r\n\r\nThe difficulty listed in the Herbs table above represents the challenge required to gather and prepare a dose of the herb in the wild. It takes one hour to make a LOG check; success results in one dose. A dose remains usable for only one day before it is spoiled.\r\n\r\nAn herbalist kit is required; otherwise the –2d6 improvisation penalty is applied.\r\n\r\nThe herbalism skill can always be used to gather and prepare herbs. For some herbs, alternate skills can also be used; for example, medicine for healing herbs, and religion for herbs dealing with undead and the like. Of course, a herbalist does not need to gather her herbs in the wild. At the GM’s option, they can also be purchased at markets and similar places; the price to purchase one dose of a herb is indicated in the Herbs table. When a herb is purchased, it does not expire in one day—it is already properly gathered, prepared, treated, and stored, and lasts until it is used. The GM should determine the availability of herbs for purchase, but generally no more than one dose should be available except in unusual circumstances.\r\n\r\nOne dose is sufficient to affect one medium-sized or smaller creature. Larger creatures require more doses. Each size category above medium doubles the dosage requirement. A large creature requires 2 doses, an enormous creature needs 4 doses, and so on.\r\n\r\nUsing an herb takes one action. No creature can be affected by a given herb more than once per day, and no creature can benefit from the effects of more than one herb at a time.\r\n\r\nAbyssal bloom. These common herbs are used to create a feeling of well-being or happiness for four hours. They are used recreationally by many and are easily available, though mildly addictive. Users are immune to the Angry and Afraid conditions while under the effect.\r\n\r\nAcorn of the pipemold flower. These acorns are potent indeed. Stored correctly by an experienced herbalist in a vial of vinegar, the acorn becomes brittle and hard. Simply swallowing it is enough to recover 1d6 Health, although doing so is a fairly unpleasant task and requires the recipient to swallow it whole.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa. Alfalfa brings good fortune. Using this herb replenishes a LUC dice pool by one die; any given creature can only benefit from this herb once per day.\r\n\r\nAngelica. This herb protects from spirits and is used in exorcisms. It grants +2 Defense vs. spirits for one hour.\r\n\r\nBittervine. Painkillers can be used to grant temporary Health—however, the effects wear off, and the temporary Health wears off at the same time. The vine grants 2d6 temporary Health for one hour.\r\n\r\nBlessed bean. These beans grant the user a +4 Defense vs. creatures with the Evil virtue for one hour.\r\n\r\nGoldbark bud. Sometimes used by student scholars and apprentice wizards, this foultasting bulb can be chewed to gain a degree of mental clarity. For one minute, those who chew the bulb gain +1d6 on all Logic based checks. Unfortunately, there is a side effect: for one hour afterwards, the recipient suffers –1d6 to those same checks.\r\n\r\nChamomile. This herb can be turned into a sleep potion. The herbalist makes a LOG check vs. the target’s Vital Defense; if he succeeds, the target falls asleep for 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nDarkberry. The darkberry is a small, sweet fruit with the ability to endow darkvision on those who eat it. Upon consuming the berry, the recipient gains superior darksight for ten minutes.\r\n\r\nDevil’s berry. Painkillers can be used to grant temporary Health—however, the effects wear off, and the temporary Health wears off at the same time. A berry grants 3d6 temporary Health for one hour, but when it wears off, the imbiber loses an additional 1d6 Health.\r\n\r\nElder bean. Antidotes work to counteract slow acting toxins. The elder bean grants poison immunity for one minute.\r\n\r\nFiredrake petals. Firedrake is a leafy bush, noted for its almost complete imperviousness to fire. Indeed, many craftsmen try to incorporate it into the walls of buildings, but the effects sadly do not last. When crushed and mixed into an ointment, and smeared all over the body, the recipient gains Soak 10 (fire) for one hour.\r\n\r\nFireseed. Strong boosters which are rare, expensive and addictive. They grant a +1d6 bonus to Agility, but for five minutes only, and that same attribute suffers a –1d6 penalty for an hour thereafter.\r\n\r\nGarlic. Properly prepared, garlic can repel vampires. This herb grants +4 Defense vs. vampires.\r\n\r\nGilly flower. A group of very rare, valuable herbs. They are highly addictive, and extremely expensive, but they grant a +4 Defense vs. magic for one hour.\r\n\r\nHorsebloom. Immunity boosters are used as preventative herbs; they increase the user’s resistance to disease. Horsebloom gives the user a +2d6 bonus to disease dice pools for one day. These herbs are often used in long-term medical care. Note that the +2d6 bonus is temporary—it wears off after a day (although another dose can be taken at that time).\r\n\r\nLotus nut. Lotus nuts are used to remove memories. Developed for trauma victims to help them forget certain events, less beneficial uses were soon found. The herbalist makes a LOG check vs. the target’s Mental Defense; on a success, the last day’s event’s are forgotten. There is a risk that more will be lost: roll 1d6, and on a roll of 6 the user loses one skill rank from a random skill.\r\n\r\nMarjoram. Marjoram eases coughs and similar ailments. It removes the Sick condition; any given creature can only benefit from this herb once per day.\r\n\r\nMistletoe. This herb is used by druids and shamans to focus nature magic. Magic using the secret of plants gains +1d6 when this herb is worn by the caster. Mistletoe counts as an implement, and does not stack with any other implement.\r\n\r\nPepper foil. This herb can enable a creature to operate as if they can breathe normally in a zero-oxygen environment (such as underwater) for 5 minutes, or in a low-oxygen environment (like thin mountaintop air) for one hour.\r\n\r\nPipe grass. Tranquilizers are used to put a patient (or victim) to sleep. These are used by hunters, criminals, and also by customers who have trouble with insomnia. The herbalist makes a LOG check vs. the target’s Mental Defense; if he succeeds, the target falls asleep for 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nQueen’s orchid. A basic, cheap herb which grants the user a temporary burst of strength. This herb gives the user a +1d6 bonus to her STR attribute for one minute. Doses do not stack with each other—taking two does not increase the bonus to +2d6.\r\n\r\nSilver garlic. Silver garlic is a particularly potent form of garlic found near silver mines. It has powerful warding properties against the undead when worn around the neck in the form of a necklace, although the smell can be off-putting. The wearer gains +4 Defense vs. all undead creatures for one hour; however, the wearer suffers a –1d6 penalty to all stealth related activity due to the obvious aroma. The bonus does not stack with the one granted by ordinary garlic.\r\n\r\nSpiderbulb. Spiderbulb grows in the ground, and has a pungent, spicy taste and aroma which can sting the eyes. When carefully sliced and placed under the tongue, it heightens the recipient’s senses of sight and hearing for ten minutes, granting +1d6 to all perception- based checks.\r\n\r\nSpirit petal. An extremely potent form of metabolic depressor, this herb completely halts metabolism and life signs for 4 hours. The user appears dead to a cursory visual inspection. The user is unconscious during this time.\r\n\r\nSticky graysap. This sap is made into a paste which is able to stop bleeding. Smeared over a creature’s wounds, it removes the Bleeding condition.\r\n\r\nStinkfruit. These fruits ward off the need for food and water for 24 hours. They are highly addictive, but fortunately they are so much more expensive than actual food and water that there is little risk of them becoming a societal problem.\r\n\r\nSwamp slime. A disgusting, foul-smelling ointment, when smeared across the eyes swamp slime can cure blindness. Any creature suffering from the Blind condition due to illness, poison, or other effects, but not including situations where vision is merely obscured, has its sight restored.\r\n\r\nTanglethorn. An antibiotic jelly which can treat small injuries. Application of tanglethorn cures 1 point of Health. However, a person can only benefit from it once per day.\r\n\r\nThunder flower. Truth herbs like thunder flower compel the imbiber to talk truthfully. In reality, they’re not a guarantee—the herbalist makes a LOG check vs. the target’s Mental Defense. The herb wears off after just 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nViolet mold. Violet mold increases cognitive processing, awareness, and reaction speed. It adds +1d6 to Initiative checks for one hour, and is mildly addictive.\r\n\r\nWhistling vine. Anti-aging herbs are applied monthly, and each application effectively reduces the user’s age by 1d6 years. However, they are slightly addictive. If an application is missed, the user ages 3d6 years (but will not age beyond his actual, natural age).\r\n\r\nYellow bark. The yellow bark of the yewclaw is a wonderful way to ease the strain of madness on an afflicted person. Burnt as an incense, and deeply inhaled, the resultant smoke calms the mind, suppressing a short-term madness completely, and easing a long-term madness for one hour.",

          "Markdown": "# Mounts\r\n\r\nMounts can be incredibly advantageous, especially in combat. They enable a traveller to move faster, and they give combatants a height advantage while making them harder to attack. While every mount has its own statistics as an independent creature, when mounted they are treated as part of the rider.\r\n\r\nA mounted combatant automatically gains the following benefits while outdoors (an interior area counts as outdoors for this purpose if it is at least 100' wide and long). Indoors, things are too cramped and crowded to make full use of a mount, and while a rider can physically be astride a steed, he does not get the below benefits.\r\n\r\n- The rider gains the Speed score, Jump score, and any other movement mode of the mount.\r\n- The rider gains +4 Melee Defense vs opponents who are not mounted..\r\n- The rider gains a +1d6 height advantage to attacks and +1d6 damage to opponents who are not mounted.\r\n- A mounted rider who is knocked down or pushed back is dismounted, falling prone to the ground and taking 1d6 blunt damage.\r\n\r\nNormally, the mount does not get hit and lose Health in combat; nor does it attack. The rider and mount are treated as one entity, unless a dismount exploit is used against the rider. Polearms having the hook trait are designed to dismount horsemen.\r\n\r\nAn attacker can choose to specifically attack a mount; this costs –2d6 to the attack, and if it is done within reach of the rider (many use long reach weapons, however), subjects the attacker to a free attack.\r\n\r\nA rider can ride a mount of their own size or larger.\r\n\r\n## Mount Statistics\r\n\r\nAfter selecting a mount, roll randomly for its statistics on the Mount Statistics table. Reroll any die showing a 1 or a 6.\r\n\r\nMount \t\t\t\t\tCost (gc) \t\tSize \t\tCarry (lbs.)\t\t Speed \t\tJump (ft.)\r\n\r\nCamel \t\t\t\t\t\t175 \t\t\tL \t\t\t1d6+1 × 100 \t\t3d6–2 \t\t2d6+4/1d6\r\n\r\nDog, riding \t\t\t\t100 \t\t\tS \t\t\t3d6+2 × 10 \t\t3d6 \t\t\t3d6/1d6+2\r\n\r\nDonkey \t\t\t\t\t30 \t\t\t\tM \t\t\t3d6 × 10 \t\t\t2d6 \t\t\t1d6+2/1d6–1\r\n\r\nEagle, giant \t\t\t\t12,000 \t\tE \t\t\t1d6+2 × 100 \t\t3d6+6 \t\tFlight\r\n\r\nElephant \t\t\t\t\t2,500 \t\t\tE \t\t\t3d6 × 100 \t\t2d6 \t\t\t—\r\n\r\nGriffon \t\t\t\t\t10,000 \t\tL \t\t\t1d6 × 100 \t\t3d6+4 \t\tFlight\r\n\r\nHorse, heavy warhorse \t1,500 \t\t\tL \t\t\t1d6+2 × 100 \t\t3d6 \t\t\t2d6+2/1d6+4\r\n\r\nHorse, light warhorse \t1,000 \t\t\tL \t\t\t1d6 × 100 \t\t3d6 \t\t\t2d6+4/1d6+4\r\n\r\nHorse, riding \t\t\t\t150 \t\t\tL \t\t\t1d6 × 100 \t\t3d6+2 \t\t3d6/2d6+3\r\n\r\nMule \t\t\t\t\t\t40 \t\t\t\tM \t\t\t2d6 × 20 \t\t\t2d6–1 \t\t1d6/1d6+2\r\n\r\nPony \t\t\t\t\t\t50 \t\t\t\tM \t\t\t3d6 × 10 \t\t\t2d6+2 \t\t2d6+2/1d6+1\r\n\r\nTiger \t\t\t\t\t\t4,000 \t\t\tL \t\t\t1d6+2 × 100 \t\t3d6 \t\t\t3d6+5/2d6\r\n\r\nWolf, great \t\t\t\t600 \t\t\tL \t\t\t3d6 × 20 \t\t\t3d6–1 \t\t3d6+5/2d6\r\n\r\n## Quirks\r\n\r\nOnce the mount’s base statistics have been determined, roll d66 twice on the following list (starting on the next page) to select two quirks.\r\n\r\n11) Fleet. The mount is unusually fast. Increase its Speed by +1d6.\r\n\r\n12) Hardy. The mount gains +2 SOAK.\r\n\r\n13) Sturdy. Increase the mount’s Carry value by 20%.\r\n\r\n14) Loyal. The mount will always immediately come to you when it is called or whistled for.\r\n\r\n15) Lame. The mount has a bad leg or foot. Reduce its Speed by –1d6.\r\n\r\n16) Intelligent. The animal is unusually intelligent and has a LOG attribute of 3 and can understand basic instructions.\r\n\r\n21) Aggressive. In combat, once each round, the animal gets a free attack against an adjacent opponent. The attack’s damage is based on size (1d6 for medium or smaller, 2d6 for large, 3d6 for enormous) and uses a 5d6 attack roll.\r\n\r\n22) Skittish. Any time the rider is attacked in melee combat, there is a 1-in-6 chance that the mount will panic and flee in a random direction at full speed.\r\n\r\n23) Leaper. Increase the mount’s Jump distances by 1d6 feet each (although vertical jumps still cannot exceed horizontal jumps).\r\n\r\n24) Guardian. The mount is especially useful as a guard. It has a 6d6 INT check.\r\n\r\n25) Proud. The mount will carry its rider, but refuses to carry bags.\r\n\r\n26) Jump-shy. The mount will not attempt a jump of any kind.\r\n\r\n31) Kicks. The mount will attack anybody it does not know who wanders close while it is not being ridden.\r\n\r\n32) Protective. Once per day, the mount takes a hit for its rider. The attack is negated.\r\n\r\n33) Loud. The animal barks, neighs, trumps, bays, etc. making it impossible to ambush anybody while the creature is nearby.\r\n\r\n34) Large. The mount is large for its species. It grants its rider an additional +1 Defense.\r\n\r\n35) Dislikes barding. The mount will not wear barding of any kind.\r\n\r\n36) Charger. When charging, the mount grants its rider an additional +1d6 damage.\r\n\r\n41) Spirited. The mount is eager to act. The rider gains +1d6 to his Initiative checks.\r\n\r\n42) Bestial. The mount is unusually bestial-looking, perhaps with broken tusks, scars, or a missing eye. The rider can spend two actions to make the mount rear up fiercely, making a 5d6 attack vs. Mental Defense of all foes within 30'. Those who are affected gain the Afraid condition.\r\n\r\n43) Hunter. The mount has an excellent sense of smell, gaining the tracking skill at a rank of 6 (3d6). The rider can use this skill as though it were his own.\r\n\r\n44) Unusual color. The mount is an unusual color for its species, making it somewhat unique.\r\n\r\n45) Willing. The mount assists when someone tries to mount it by lowering itself to accommodate the maneuver. In effect, the mount can always be mounted as a free action.\r\n\r\n46) Placid. The mount is unusually docile and friendly.\r\n\r\n51) Rotund. The mount enjoys its food a bit too much. It is round and fat. It gains +5 Soak but suffers –2 Speed.\r\n\r\n52) Devil-touched. Somehow the mount has a little devil in its lineage, given away by its red eyes. It grants Soak 2 (fire) to its rider.\r\n\r\n53) Plodder. The mount is especially suited to long distances. Its Speed counts as 4 higher for wilderness travel.\r\n\r\n54) Light-footed. Especially light on its feet, the mount does not leave tracks except in snow or similar terrain.\r\n\r\n55) Independent. Once per day, for one round, the rider can leave the mount to handle directions and movement decisions and focus on other activities; one move that turn is a free action.\r\n\r\n56) Vertigo. The mount is afraid of heights. Any height, bridge, or ledge of over 10' height requires the mount to be coaxed. This takes an action and is a Routine [10] CHA check.\r\n\r\n61) Fey-touched. Somehow the mount has a little fey in its lineage. It grants +1 Mental Defense to its rider.\r\n\r\n62) Small. The mount is small for its species. It gains +1 Speed, but its Carry capacity is reduced by 10%.\r\n\r\n63) Emaciated. No matter how much it eats, this mount always looks painfully thin.\r\n\r\n64) Shy. The mount takes a while to become acclimatized to its new owner due to its shy nature. For the first week, it holds back, moving at –2 Speed and not allowing quickmount abilities to work.\r\n\r\n65) Greedy. When food is unattended within 30' of the mount, it moves to it and begins to chow down. It takes a Challenging [13] CHA check to persuade it to leave the food alone (a successful check regains control for five minutes).\r\n\r\n66) Fearful. The mount is afraid of fire, and will not move within 5' of a fire source unless a Difficult [16] CHA check is made to persuade it.\r\n\r\n## Barding\r\n\r\nBarding can be acquired to protect a mount. Barding is similar to regular armor, and comes in many of the same types.\r\n\r\nThe prices below indicate the cost of medium-sized barding. Double the price for each creature size above medium, and reduce it by half if the creature is smaller than medium sized.\r\n\r\nBarding does not inflict a Defense penalty on the mount wearing it, unlike armor worn by characters. While wearing barding, a mount uses either its natural SOAK or the SOAK of its barding, whichever is higher.\r\n\r\nBarding can customized with any of the same enhancements as regular armor, and it follows the same quality rules.\r\n\r\nBarding \tCost (gc) \tSOAK\r\n\r\nCloth \t\t30 \t\t\t2\r\n\r\nPadded \t35 \t\t\t2\r\n\r\nHide \t\t40 \t\t\t3\r\n\r\nLeather \t50 \t\t\t4\r\n\r\nRingmail \t70 \t\t\t5\r\n\r\nScalemail\t 130 \t\t6\r\n\r\nChainmail\t250 \t\t6\r\n\r\nPlatemail \t2,000 \t\t9",

          "Markdown": "# Equipment, Skills & Quality\r\n\r\nSometimes equipment is of a higher quality. Such items are more expensive, but grant the user bonuses to attribute checks made while using them. Equipment contributes to a dice pool if it is of high quality or greater. Performing the action already assumes you are using appropriate basic tools.\r\n\r\nStandard equipment doesn’t contribute to the dice pool; it merely allows you to perform the action without suffering any penalties for improvised equipment. For example, a rifle allows you to shoot somebody, a lockpick allows you to pick a lock, and a healing pouch allows you to perform emergency medical aid.\r\n\r\nTo gain an equipment bonus, you need high quality equipment or better. A high quality sword gives you +1d6 to your attack dice pool, a high quality lockpick gives you +1d6 to your AGI dice pool when picking a lock, and so on.\r\n\r\nYou can also improvise equipment if you don’t have the right tools available. This inflicts a -2d6 penalty to your dice pool. You can use a hairpin to pick a lock, but that’s an improvised item.\r\n\r\nThis same rule applies in combat. When trying to attack somebody, the character rolls a dice pool made up of an attribute, a skill, and sometimes equipment bonuses.\r\n\r\nAn item cannot change quality, or be upgraded to a higher quality.\r\n\r\nThe table below details the various quality levels.\r\n\r\nDice Pool. This indicates the contribution to a dice pool that high quality equipment grants (subject to minimum skill limits).\r\n\r\nRarity. This is an indication of how common high quality equipment is.\r\n\r\nMin. Skill. Effective equipment quality is limited by skill level – you cannot gain more dice in your dice pool from equipment than you have from skills. If you have 2d6 in your dice pool from your lockpicking skill, you cannot gain an additional 3d6 from mastercraft lockpicks.\r\n\r\nThis applies to all equipment, including gear, weapons, and armor. If the user does not have the minimum skill level required to benefit from equipment’s quality, then the quality of the equipment is effectively reduced to match the user’s skill level. For example, a character with 3 ranks (2d6; skilled) in light armor treats artisanal light armor as exceptional, and only gains the benefits of exceptional light armor.\r\n\r\nUpgrades. Weapons and armor can be upgraded, adding new features. The upgrade capacity is given by its size (for weapons) or type (for armor). Higher quality weapons and armor gain additional upgrade slots.\r\n\r\nArmor. High quality armor gains a SOAK bonus.\r\n\r\nVehicle. High quality vehicles gain a SPEED bonus.\r\n\r\nQuality\t\tPrice\t\t\t\t\tRarity\t\t\tDice Pool\t\t\tMin.

          "Markdown": "# Special Ammunition\r\n\r\nSpecial ammunition can be obtained for projectile weapons in clips of 20 rounds (weight of 1lb) at the indicated price. A weapon can only hold ammo of one type at a given time unless otherwise noted. Switching ammo counts as reloading. Only projectile weapons which do ballistic damage can use special ammunition.\r\n\r\nArmor-Piercing (100 $/cr). Armor-piercing rounds ignore 10 points of SOAK, but do half damage.\r\n\r\nHollow Point (100 $/cr). Hollow point rounds do extra damage to unarmored targets. They increase the damage of a projectile weapon by 1d6, but double the target's SOAK.\r\n\r\nRubber Bullets (100 $/cr). Rubber bullets can be used to cause non-lethal damage to the target (giving it the Stun trait). They are popular with bounty hunters seeking to take their prey alive, although the default on the frontiers tends to be “Dead or Alive”; and dead is easier. Rubber ammunition can be purchased for the same price as regular ammunition in any projectile non-automatic weapon.\r\n\r\nTracers (100 $/cr). Highly visible rounds which assist in aiming, directing fire, and marking targets at the expense of revealing the gunner’s position. Using tracer rounds causes a 1d6 penalty to any cover or concealment bonus enjoyed by the gunner, but grants a +1d6 bonus for one round to all ranged combatants firing on the same target (a successful hit is not required to grant this bonus). Note that beam weapons like phasers can act like tracers if the operator so chooses. Using tracer rounds (or a beam weapon as a tracer) requires two actions.",

          "Markdown": "# Weapon Traits\r\n\r\nWeaon entres on [WOINGEAR](http://www.woingear.com) indiciate any particular properties or notes associated with a weapon or item.\r\n\r\nAgile. An agile weapon is complex and difficult to use. You need an AGI of 8 to use it without penalty, otherwise you take a –1d6 penalty to your attack rolls. These weapons always use AGI for their attack rolls.\r\n\r\nArc. The weapon fires in a ballistic arc; no direct line-of-sight is required, as long as there is a ballistic route which can be taken.\r\n\r\nAT. Anti-tank ability allows a weapon to instead be fired directly at a vehicle, doing double damage to vehicles and objects. When used in this manner, the weapon does not do burst damage.\r\n\r\nAuto. Automatic weapons are better at suppressive fire. They give an additional die of cover to protected allies.\r\n\r\nBeam. Beam weapons, such as phasers and lasers, project a visible continuous line of energy at their target. For this reason, they can , at the operator's choice, operate as tracers.\r\n\r\nBypass. A weapon with this trait is able to ignore shields. An example is the Eastern three-section-staff, which can be used to strike around a shield.\r\n\r\nClimber. A weapon with this trait counts as climbing gear.\r\n\r\nClose-quarters. A close-quarters weapon can be used even when its user is grappling. These weapons gain +1d6 to attacks against foes in the same square.\r\n\r\nCombust. Weapons with the combust trait are more likely to set their target on fire, and when they do so, the effect is more severe. A critical hit from a weapon with this trait inflicts a severe Burning condition, requiring a roll of 6 to remove it.\r\n\r\nDouble. Double weapons are melee weapons treated as though they were two weapons, one in each hand. This typically means that the attacker will gain an additional attack per turn with it. Review the combat rules on dual-wielding and double weapons.\r\n\r\nHeavy. A heavy weapon is difficult to use. You need a Strength of 8 to use it without penalty, otherwise you take a –1d6 penalty to your attack rolls. These weapons always use STR for their attack rolls.\r\n\r\nHook. Many polearms incorporate hooks. Against a mounted target, a successful strike can dismount the rider. When using it to dismount a target, a hooked weapon does no direct damage and costs 2d6.\r\n\r\nHuge. A huge weapon (which is almost always heavy as well) is so large that medium-sized or smaller creatures need STR 10 to avoid the heavy penalty.\r\n\r\nInitiative bonus. Some weapons are lighter and faster than others. These may grant a bonus to Initiative.\r\n\r\nMelee Defense bonus. Some weapons grant a flat bonus to the wielder’s Melee Defense score.\r\n\r\nMin. Weapons with this trait have a minimum range. They cannot target anything within that range. The minimum range is noted in parenthesis - e.g. “Min (8)”.\r\n\r\nMounted. These weapons must be affixed (mounted or stood on the ground) and take two full actions to set-up before use. If they are moved, another two actions is required to set them up at the new site.\r\n\r\nReach. A reach weapon is a longer melee weapon. It can attack opponents up to 10' away. Weapons with long reach can attack up to 15' away, but cannot attack adjacent targets.\r\n\r\nRecoil. This weapon’s recoil is enough to affect the user in zero-g and lo-grav (Explosive Ordnance).\r\n\r\nRestrains. A weapon which restrains does so on a successful hit, giving the target the Restrained condition.\r\n\r\nSacrificial. Sacrificial weapons are often used in ritual and rites. They gain +1d6 to attack a prone foe.\r\n\r\nSeeker. These weapons use heat or laser guidance and gain +2d6 to their attack rolls as long as a heat source is the target.\r\n\r\nSet. Some piercing polearms can be set as a single action against incoming attackers. This creates a cone (10' for reach weapons, 15' for long reach weapons) in the direction in which the weapon is set. As an attacker enters the cone from the front edge, it is subject to an automatic attack from the polearm. If successful, the attacker is stopped in its tracks, and its movement ends for that action, as well as taking damage as normal. The attacker may attempt to enter the cone again.\r\n\r\nShield. The wielder of this weapon is automatically considered to be also wielding a shield of the same size category. This applies for the purposes of Melee Defense only.\r\n\r\nSidearm. Weapons designated as sidearms gain +1d6 to hit at point-blank range (when the user is adjacent to the target) and do not suffer a penalty for firing at an adjacent target.\r\n\r\nSingle. A weapon with this quality can only be used once per round, even if the user is able to make multiple attacks.\r\n\r\nStonebreaker. These weapons are designed to break stone and do +1d6 damage to stone targets.\r\n\r\nStun. When the target is reduced to 0 Health by a weapon with the Stun trait, it is unconscious but not dying. It wakes with 1 Health 5 minutes later.\r\n\r\nThrown. A melee weapon with this trait can be thrown with the noted range increment. For example, a weapon with the trait “Thrown (3)” has a range increment of 3. Without this trait, a thrown weapon has a range increment of 2 and counts as improvised (inflicting a –2d6 penalty to the attack roll).\r\n\r\nTrap. Some weapons can be used to trap a foe. A weapon which can trap an enemy does so on a successful hit, rendering the target immobilized until they shake off the status.\r\n\r\nVersatile. A versatile weapon has two damage values: the first is for the weapon used one-handed, and the second is for the weapon used two-handed.\r\n\r\nVicious. Some weapons are barbed or jagged; conditions from such weapons are harder to shake off, and inflict a –1d6 penalty to attempts to do so.\r\n\r\nWoodbreaker. Designed to split wood, these weapons do +1d6 damage against wood targets.",

          "Markdown": "# Evocation Enhancements\r\n\r\nEvoke [element]\r\n\r\nEvocations are the flashy, impressive end of spellcasting, and the most directly applicable to combat. Evocations are how casters throw fire, blast enemies, or wield ice and lightning as weapons. For this reason, evocations are popular amongst many mages.\r\n\r\nNote that in terms of damage types, Good damage is usually referred to as holy damage, and evil damage is normally referred to as unholy damage. Death damage is usually referred to as necrotic damage.\r\n\r\nAn evocation cantrip can deal 1 point of damage.\r\n\r\n## Damage\r\n\r\nElemental Damage. Cost 1 MP; 2 MP per +1d6 damage. All Evoke spells deal a base 1d6 points of damage of the secret’s type to all in the spell’s area if you spend 1 MP. You can increase this damage to 2d6 by spending 2 MP instead, and thereafter by an additional 1d6 for each further 2 MP you spend. Note some elements have a bonus effect when you spend 2 or more MP:\r\n\r\nAcid. Acid coats affected creatures and objects, continuing to deal 1 point of acid damage per round. The acid eventually becomes inert after a number of rounds equal to the MP spent, but it can also be washed off with about one gallon of water for every 5' square of area. A creature can scrape or wipe acid off itself or a comparably-sized object with two actions, though this usually ruins the scraping implement.\r\n\r\nAir. Intense winds can knock affected creatures across the battlefield. All creatures affected by a single spell are knocked in the same direction, though if the spell has an area of effect you may knock creatures away from a chosen central point. Creatures in the area of effect successfully hit by the spell are blown back 5'. Swarms of tiny flying creatures are dispersed. Clouds of non-magical mist and smoke are dispersed automatically. Larger creatures are unaffected.\r\n\r\nFire. The spell’s flames ignite flammable material. The area is illuminated with firelight each round. Only highly flammable materials, such as exposed oil or sheets of paper, catch fire, but for an additional +3 MP materials that can burn but need to be coaxed, such as logs, catch fire, and the flames to 1d6 damage to those who enter or start their turn in the area. Note that to make a living creature catch fire, a critical hit is needed as normal.\r\n\r\nForce. Force damage cannot affect inanimate objects. However, it harms incorporeal or intangible creatures normally. Force damage has no other side effects.\r\n\r\nIce. The spell can freeze affected creatures and objects. Frozen objects become brittle, becoming vulnerable (1d6) to blunt damage. The freezing effect ends at the end of the spell’s duration. Normally only tiny creatures and objects are affected in this manner, but for 2 extra MP it affects small objects and creatures, for 4 extra MP it affects medium objects and creatures, for 6 MP it affects large objects and creatures, and so on (2 MP per size category). The area within an area affected by an ice evocation becomes slippery.\r\n\r\nLava. Affected objects become dangerously hot (baking) for the spell’s duration. Creatures are not burned in this way, but if they bear metal armor or weapons, they suffer 1d6 fire damage per round until the spell ends or they drop the metallic objects. This applies both to lava effects, and to general heating which does not involve actual fire or flames.\r\n\r\nLight. For an extra 3 MP, you can create bright light that will blind those within the area on a successful attack roll. For 5 MP, the bright light will stun them. For 7 MP it will do both.\r\n\r\nLightning. Electrical shocks pass through water, attacking anybody in contact with the water but outside the spell’s area of effect, although this damage dissipates by 1d6 damage for every 10' from the point of origin.\r\n\r\nMist. Fog flows around barriers and through narrow cracks. Creatures behind cover do not gain cover bonuses against mist spells, and the spell’s area of effect will even bypass barriers if there is a path for the fog to flow.\r\n\r\nOoze. Affected areas are coated in slime, which makes it difficult terrain.\r\n\r\nSound. The sound can shatter glass and similar materials.\r\n\r\nWater. Affected creatures and objects in the area are drenched with liquid water. This water can do such things as put out exposed flames in the area, wash away acid and ooze, and cool objects baking because of exposure to lava.",

          "Markdown": "# Exotic Stars\r\n\r\nSometimes stars are made of something other than the usual electrons, protons, and neutrons. Quarks, strange matter, and preons can also make up stars, often prevented from gravitational collapse by quantum features.\r\n\r\nExotic stars can cause a variety of conditions in the surrounding area of space and on those planets which may orbit them. These conditions can be as exotic and unusual as the stars themselves. These objects provide an excellent way to introduce some of the more fantastic science fiction plots.\r\n\r\nQuark & strange stars are rare neutron stars made of quarks or of strange matter.\r\n\r\nElectroweak stars are super-dense neutron stars; the quarks have been converted to leptons via the electroweak force, and radiation pressure is all that prevents gravitational collapse.\r\n\r\nPreon stars are compact stars composed of subatomic particles known as preons. They are smaller and lighter than neutron stars and white dwarfs, but have greater densities.\r\n\r\nBoson stars are made out of bosons and were formed during the primordial stages of the big bang.\r\n\r\nDark stars have an escape velocity equal to or greater than the speed of light, but are stable against collapse into a black hole. Dark stars are effectively “invisible” stars and are almost impossible to detect even with advanced sensors.\r\n\r\nQ-stars are known as “gray holes” and are very heavy neutron stars.\r\n\r\nIce stars are stars of intense cold. These stars radiate out that cold for many millions of miles in every direction.",

          "Markdown": "# Fantasy Armor Customizations\r\n\r\nBlinding (5,000 gc). This customization can only be applied to metal armor. The armor is polished to such an extent that it reflects light like a mirror. The wearer gains +4 Defense against attacks dependent upon radiation (heat, light), and when in bright sunlight gains +2 Defense against all other attacks. Additionally, once per day, it can reflect a spell, granting the wearer immunity to that one attack. Anyone wearing blinding armor suffers –3d6 to any attempts to hide.\r\n\r\nCamouflage (300 gc). Camouflage armor is an easy and cheap way to blend into the surroundings. Camouflage can be applied to any armor, and must be selected for a specific terrain (desert, snow, jungle, night). Wearing the correct camouflage armor for the terrain grants a +1d6 bonus to checks to hide. This does not stack with the chameleon property, and cannot be combined with the blinding property.\r\n\r\nChameleon (5,000 gc). The ultimate in camouflage, a chameleon enchantment rapidly changes color to react to its environment. Chameleon armor grants a +2d6 bonus to checks to hide. This does not stack with the camouflage property, and cannot be combined with the blinding property.\r\n\r\nDiscrete (10,000 gc). This powerful enchantment makes the armor invisible to the naked eye. Even plate armor can be worn over clothing, and to the casual viewer, the wearer appears to be unarmored. This cannot be combined with the blinding property.\r\n\r\nElf-silk (10,000 gc). This customization can only be applied at the time of creation, and can only be applied to cloth or padded armor. Armor made of elf-silk gains +2 SOAK, is able to hold two additional enchantments, cannot be destroyed, and will never dull. Elf-silk armor can never be lower than exceptional quality, and weighs only 1 lb.\r\n\r\nFortified (5,000 gc). Fortified armor is designed in a way that weak spots are carefully protected. This is intense and expert work. To score a critical hit against a foe wearing fortified armor, four sixes are required on the attack roll, rather than three.\r\n\r\nHealing (5,000 gc). Once per day, the wearer can use an action to magically heal herself 3d6 Health. For each additional 2,000 gc spent on this enchantment, the healing increases by +1d6 Health.\r\n\r\nInvisibility (10,000 gc). Once per day, the wearer of this armor can use a single action to turn invisible for up to five minutes.\r\n\r\nMighty (20,000 gc). This armor looks large and powerful, almost fantastically so. The wearer gains +1d6 to his STR dice pool.\r\n\r\nMithril (base cost × 10). This customization can only be applied at the time of forging, and can only be applied to metal armor. Armor made of mithril gains +2 SOAK, is able to hold two additional enchantments, cannot be destroyed, and will never dull. Mithril armor can never be lower than exceptional quality. Mithril is a silver-colored metal mined by dwarves.\r\n\r\nResistant (1,000 gc). For every 1,000 gc (and each slot used), the armor gains +2 SOAK against a specified elemental damage type, chosen at the time of enchantment. This stacks with the armor’s existing SOAK.\r\n\r\nSilent (2,000 gc). Silent armor uses a noise-dampening enchantment to grant a +1d6 bonus to Agility checks to be stealthy, and—as a side-effect—provide 5 SOAK vs. sonic damage.\r\n\r\nStaunching (10,000 gc). The wearer becomes immune to the Bleeding condition.\r\n\r\nSpikes (80 gc). This adjustment looks intimidating and exotic; however, their primary purpose is to cause damage to opponents who attempt to grab the wearer. Any attempt to grab the wearer of spiked armor causes the attacker 1d6 piercing damage.\r\n\r\nThermal (250 gc). This armor protects against cold environments and grants 5SOAK vs. cold damage.\r\n\r\nUnencumbering (2,000 gc). This armor is designed to be especially easy to move in. Unencumbering armor counts as one weight category lower for thepurposes of determining Defense penalties. Medium armor becomes light, and heavy armor becomes medium.\r\n\r\nWeightless (10,000 gc). Weightless armor is enchanted so that it does not hinder the wearer at all. The wearer suffers no penalties to Defense, and the armor weighs 0 lbs. when worn.",

Creating elixirs of life in bubbling cauldrons and seeking the secrets of magical chemistry, alchemists are true creators. Many make a living selling their concoctions. Unlike herbalism, alchemy involves a touch of magic.\r\n\r\nFor each alchemical concoction, you should roll and note down an Alchemical Science result. This describes the nature of the concoction, whether it requires you to dilute amber in a jade keg, or cool mercury in a ruby flute.\r\n\r\n- Explosive alchemy. You can create an explosive concoction using your alchemy kit. This takes a full round (two actions), and the concoction can be thrown (range increment 3, radius 5', damage 3d6 fire). The concoction can only be stored for 5 minutes before it stops working.\r\n- Healing potion. You can use your alchemy kit to heal 2d6 HEALTH in yourself or any creature you can touch. No creature may benefit from this more than once per day.\r\n- Gaseous concoction (requires Concoction, alchemy 5). Your concoction can be thrown in a glass bottle which breaks on inpact, causing a 10' radius area of gas.\r\n- Greater healing potion (requires Healing Potion, alchemy 3). Your healing ability using your alchemy kit improves. You may now restore 3d6 HEALTH.\r\n- Concoction. Choose one condition. You can spend five minutes to create a concoction which, when drunk (and a MAG vs. the appropriate DEFENSE attack is made), gives the target that condition. You may take this exploit multiple times, choosing a new condition each time.\r\n- Strong concoction (requires Concoction, alchemy 3). One concoction you can create using the Concoction exploit now gives the target the severe stage of the condition.\r\n- Sticky concoction (requires Concoction, alchemy 3). You may turn your concoction into a substance which can be delivered via a blade or an arrow. Apply an already-created concoction to an edged weapon. The next successful damaging attack made by that weapon will deliver the concoction to the target as though it had drunk it. This only lasts for one successful attack or for five minutes, whichever comes first.\r\n- Protective oil. You may spend 5 minutes to create a an oil which, when smeared over a creature, grants it SOAK 2 against one damage type. This is enough to protect against climate-based effects.\r\n\r\n## Archer (1d6 years)\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: AGI 3+\r\n\r\nAttributes: STR +1, AGI +1, LUC +1, REP +1\r\n\r\nSkill choices: bows, perception, carousing, survival\r\n\r\nYou joined the army as an archer, manning walls and front lines in times of war.\r\n\r\n- Long shot. You have an eye for distance. You can double the range increment of a bow.\r\n- Bowyer. You know how to maintain your equipment. One standard quality bow becomes a high quality weapon, as long as you spend an hour maintaining it every day.\r\n- Careful aim. When aiming, your bonus to hit increases to +2d6.\r\n- Rapid shot. Your rate of fire increases; once per turn you can fire two shots instead of one.\r\n- Stand your ground. As long as you do not move, you can plant arrows in the ground and loose two shots every action.\r\n- Double shot. You notch two arrows and let both fly simultaneously. Each must be directed at a different target, and both targets must be within 10' of each other. You cannot combine this ability with any other exploits.\r\n- Intercepting shot (requires INT 8+; Rapid Shot). You can shoot another arrow out of the sky as a reaction. Roll an opposed attack roll against that of the attacker's arrow; if you succeed, the arrow is split and falls harmlessly to the ground.\r\n\r\n## Assassin (1d6 years)\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: stealth\r\n\r\nAttributes: AGI +1, INT +1, WIL +1, REP +1\r\n\r\nSkill choices: stealth, thievery, perception, intimidate, disguise, [melee weapon], [ranged weapon], herbalism\r\n\r\nA killer for hire, you mastered the skills of assassination.\r\n\r\n- Surprise attack. If you successfully hit a target before it becomes aware of you, you gain a +2d6 damage bonus.\r\n- Death blow (requires Surprise Attack). Your damage bonus for attacking unaware targets increases to +4d6.\r\n- Poison resistance. You become resistant to poisons, gaining SOAK 5 poison and an additional die in your countdown die pool when poisoned.\r\n- Quiet kill. You are a master of silent death. Any target you kill during the ambush turn dies silently and without obvious visible signs. Nobody will notice that the target is dead for one minute, and will require a Strenuous [21] INT check to realize it thereafter.\r\n- Weak point. Once per enemy you may ignore any SOAK score it possesses by targeting a weak spot. You can never use this ability on the same enemy again.\r\n\r\n## Barbarian (1d6 years)\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: None\r\n\r\nAttributes: STR +1, END +1, AGI +1, INT +1\r\n\r\nSkill choices: swords, axes, spears, [physical], [outdoor], hardy, herbalism\r\n\r\nTribal warriors from the very fringes of civilization, barbarians are wild and uncouth.

With a CHA vs. MENTAL DEFENSE attack, you can give a target within 30' who can see and hear you the Afraid condition.\r\n- Scarred visage (requires Beastly Visage, Leathery Skin). You are covered in scars. You are immune to the Bleeding condition.\r\n- Keen senses. You gain +1d6 to perception checks.\r\n- Trophy collection (requires Set In The Old Ways).

You may only claim a trophy if you delivered the killing blow to a creature of Medium size or larger.\r\n- Reap the whirlwind. You may spend two actions to make one melee attack against every adjacent foe. You cannot add additional exploits to these attacks.\r\n- Feral.

You gain SOAK  6 from a permanent arcane shield, which surrounds you while you are awake. This does not stack with other forms of SOAK .\r\n- Area Specialist. You are expert at area-of-effect battlefield spells. You pay half the normal MP price for area of effect.\r\n- Armored Wizard. You are adept at wearing armor. If you don’t already have it, you gain 6 ranks (3d6) in medium armor. Medium armor which you wear and inscribe with battle runes gains +2 SOAK  beyond that which is would ordinarily offer.\r\n- Artillery. One role of a battle mage is as artillery support for infantry. You pay half the normal MP price for range.\r\n- Master of Terrain. You understand that terrain is an important factor in war. You may make a 30' diameter area within 100' difficult terrain for one minute as a single action.\r\n- Siege Mage. Your spells ignore the SOAK of non-organic objects such as walls and doors.\r\n\r\n## Berserker (1d6 years)\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: STR 6+, Feral exploit\r\n\r\nAttributes: STR +1, END +1, CHA +1, LUC +1\r\n\r\nSkill choices: sword, axe, spear, [physical], [unarmed], hardy\r\n\r\nSome barbarians become berserkers – raging warriors of fury.\r\n\r\n- Frenzy. You can fly into a berserk rage. When berserk, you must attack the closest enemy, and move on to the next closest thereafter. You gain SOAK +5 (even when wearing armor) and +1d6 damage.

You may repeat this exploit, gaining 3d6x100gc each time.\r\n\r\n## Cleric [1d6 years]\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: religion.\r\n\r\nAttributes: WIL +1, LOG +1, CHA +1, MAG +1\r\n\r\nSkill choices: healing, herbalism, religion, leadership. history, local knowledge, staves, maces, [magical]\r\n\r\nThe cleric devotes his or her life to a higher power, hoping to serve that power’s will. Whether the cleric serves a noble god or a vicious demon lord, he or she gains power from faith, and learns to wield powerful magic in the service of his or her deity. Clerics are also trained to be capable warriors, able to defend themselves physically if their spells fail them. Since clerics deal more in abstract realms of the soul and the spirit, their magic has a definite slant toward the intangible, generally eschewing direct offensive magic in favor of spells that affect creatures’ essence and behavior, or that make creatures more or less able to battle. Most clerics worship one specific deity from a pantheon, but still respect other members of that pantheon, even if they are not actual followers. The agendas of deities’ worshippers may conflict in the realm of mortals, but it is folly to defy even enemy deities. Thus, though a cleric may choose to change the deity he or she reveres, if the clerics truly abandons the pantheon, he or she will never be accepted by any deity, being forced to rely on mortal magic alone.\r\n\r\n- Beatification (requires religion 6). You gain the Virtue of your god. Additionally, all damage you do is damage of that Virtue type, whatever the delivery instrument.\r\n- Blessing/curse (requires Portfolio). You can issue a blessing or a curse. This takes one minute, lasts one hour, and affects one creature within 30'. A curse makes the target unable to access its LUC pool; a blessing grants it a bonus 3d6 to its LUC pool for the hour.\r\n- Portfolio. Choose either the Good or the Evil virtue. If you choose the good, your touch can heal 1d6 HEALTH as a single action (although any given creature can only benefit from this once per day). If you choose the evil, it inflicts 1d6 evil damage beyond your natural damage. You may never learn the opposite Virtue to the one you chose. You may take this exploit multiple times; each time you do, your healing (or damage) increases by 1d6.\r\n- Sense virtue (requires Portfolio). You are able to sense the presence of (but not the location of) any beings or objects within 60' with a Virtue opposite to that of the secret you chose.\r\n\r\n## Diabolist [1d6 years]\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: religion, secret of evil\r\n\r\nAttributes: WIL +1, CHA +1, LUC +1, MAG +1\r\n\r\nSkill choices: [magical], religion, alchemy, concentration, [social], linguistics, knives, law\r\n\r\nA diabolist consorts with the infernal, and dabbles in the darkest and most dangerous of magical arts – he deals with demons and devils, risking his very soul in the process. A diabolist needs a strong will, for devils and demons know the powers of temptation, deceit, and the lure of pure evil. A diabolist knows how to summon infernal creatures and bind them to his will.\r\n\r\n- Blood magic (requires Faustian Pact). You are now able to cast spells for fewer MP by spilling your own blood. As an action, you may do either 1d6 or 2d6 damage to yourself; the MP cost of the next spell cast within one minute is reduced by the number of d6s damage you cause.\r\n- Demonic traits (requires Faustian Pact). You begin to take on the appearance of the infernal. You may take this exploit up to six times. Each time you take it, roll 1d6 to determine the trait you gain; if a trait is duplicated, roll again.\r\n\r\n1. Horns. +1d6 Magic Points\r\n\r\n2. Red eyes. Darkvision 60'\r\n\r\n3. Claws. +1d6 to unarmed damage\r\n\r\n4. Red skin. SOAK 5 (fire)\r\n\r\n5. Hooves. +1 SPEED\r\n\r\n6. Tail. +1 AGILITY\r\n\r\n- Faustian pact. Your Faustian pact begins; but power comes at a price. You gain 2d6 additional Magic Points. Whenever you cast a spell, you take damage equal to the number of MP placed in that spell. However, you know that true power comes later to those who are patient.\r\n- Infernal mysteries. You learn the basics of diabolism. You gain the summoning, abjuration, and hexing skills at 1 rank (1d6) if you do not already have them, and learn the secret of demons.\r\n- Imp. You gain an imp familiar which will do your bidding. It will undertake dangerous tasks, but to persuade it to do something suicidal (or near-so) requires a Difficult [16] CHA check; if you fail, your imp betrays you.\r\n\r\n## Druid [1d6 years]\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: nature.\r\n\r\nAttributes: INT +1, WIL +1, END +1, MAG +1\r\n\r\nSkill choices: [outdoor], nature, healing, staves, [crafting], herbalism, [magical]\r\n\r\nGuardians of nature, druids are attuned with the natural forces of the world.

With a successful CHA vs. MENTAL DEFENSE check, you can give an animal the Charmed condition for one hour.\r\n- Animal companion. You gain an animal companion in the form of a wolf. This companion will accompany and defend you. If your companion dies, you attract a new companion in one month. However, if you abuse your companion (for example by sending it ahead to set off traps), it will leave you and you will never be able to replace the companion. The companion is bright for its species, but has no special intelligence or abilities. You may take this exploit multiple times, gaining an extra animal companion each time.\r\n- Ageless (requires Poison Immunity). You no longer age and become effectively immortal, saving accidental death.\r\n- Beast form. You may transform into a small or medium-sized animal (and back again) once per day for up to one hour. You cannot speak in this form, and retain your own mental attributes, but otherwise use the animal's statistics.\r\n- Companion link (requires Animal Companion). You gain a telepathic link with your animal companion with a range of 1 mile; this enables you to send it instructions and to see through its eyes.\r\n- Elemental druid. You gain any two of the secrets of air, earth, fire, and water.\r\n- Greater beast form (requires Beast form). You may now change into a large or tiny animal.\r\n- Nature's passage. You can move through woodland areas and thick undergrowth without any speed reduction, and leave no tracks or traces of your passing unless you choose to do so.\r\n- Nature priest. You gain the secret of beasts and the secret of plants.\r\n- Poison immunity. You become immune to all poisons and poison damage.\r\n- Speak with animals. You may freely speak with animals, although they do not gain special intelligence or knowledge.\r\n\r\n## Enchanter (1d6 years)\r\n\r\nA master of the mind, you seek to expand your influence and control over others.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: enchantment 6+, CHA 10+\r\n\r\nAttributes: INT +1, WIL +1, CHA +1, MAG +1\r\n\r\nSkill Choices: enchantment, compulsion, [social], hypnotism\r\n\r\n- Deceiver.

Make a MAG mental attack against a target within 30’; that target will perform one non-harmful action of your choosing.\r\n- Natural Control. You are able to manipulate the minds of others easily. With a wave and a word you can move somebody who can hear and understand you one stage along a WIL status track with a successful CHA mental attack.\r\n- Telepathy. You are able to freely send telepathic messages to those you have spent at least 8 hours with, as long as you can see them.\r\n\r\n## Firemage [1d6 years]\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: secret of fire.\r\n\r\nAttributes: MAG +1, AGI +1, CHA +1, LOG +1\r\n\r\nSkill choices: [magical], [lore], [crafting], bluffing, perception, reactions, knives\r\n\r\nFiremages are fascinated by fire. They love the way it flickers and dances; they excel at creating flames, throwing fire, and delight in creating and controlling infernos and conflagrations. Firemages can sometimes be identified by a slight sent of sulfur.\r\n\r\n- Fiery affinity. Your focus on fire grants you +1d6 to any attribute which interacts with fire or heat.\r\n- Firebolt (requires Flaming Touch). You can throw a bolt of fire as a single ranged attack (using your MAG attribute) which has a range increment of 30' and does 2d6 fire damage.\r\n- Firebolt, greater (requires Firebolt).

Cursed creatures cannot take actions having to do with their signature talent, as determined by the GM.\r\n    - Brainless Babbling. The cursed creature cannot communicate with anything more than gestures, grunts, and gibberish, nor understand other people’s linguistic communications.

          "Markdown": "# Fantasy Weapon Customizations\r\n\r\nBlack metal (base cost × 10). This customization can only be applied at the time of forging. A weapon made of black metal is able to hold two additional enchantments, cannot be destroyed, and will never dull. Black metal weapons can never be lower than exceptional quality. Black metal can be found in meteorites or in certain very dark and deep places.\r\n\r\nBlessed (500 gc). A blessed weapon’s damage gains the good type in addition to its regular damage type.\r\n\r\nCursed (10,000 gc). The wounds from this weapon will not heal naturally. Only healing magic can restore the victim’s health.\r\n\r\nDisease (5,000 gc). A successful strike from this weapon imparts a disease onto its victim. The disease must be chosen at the time of enchantment.\r\n\r\nElemental (2,000 gc). Once per day, the weapon can burst into flame or freeze into ice (chosen at the time of enchantment). The damage it does gains the fire or cold type. The effect lasts for one minute. If this enchantment is applied a second time, it lasts for 5 minutes; a third time makes it last an hour; four times means it will last all day.\r\n\r\nEversharp (1,000 gc). An eversharp weapon will never go blunt or rust. This enchantment can only be applied to bladed or pointed metal weapons.\r\n\r\nFast (10,000 gc). The weapon is unnaturally light and fast. If the wielder attacks twice in a round with it, he gains a third attack as a free action.\r\n\r\nHigh Damage (1,000 gc). The weapon has been modified to make it more deadly. A club might have added spikes, or a flintlock might burn powder more efficiently. The weapon deals +1d6 damage.\r\n\r\nLight (500 gc). When drawn, the weapon emits a cold bright light in a 30' radius circle.\r\n\r\nMalice (1,000 gc). A weapon imbued with malice is cruel and seeks to kill and maim. Every time its wielder slays a being, he recharges a LUC die (but cannot exceed his normal maximum LUC pool).\r\n\r\nPernicious (10,000 gc). More malevolent even than malice weapons, a pernicious weapon cannot be drawn without killing. The wielder loses 1d6 Health every minute until the weapon kills a victim. The weapon cannot be discarded until it has been sheathed.\r\n\r\nRangefinder (1,000 gc). When placed upon a bow or other ranged weapon, the weapon’s range increment increases by 50%. This enchantment cannot be placed upon ammunition.\r\n\r\nReturning (1,000 gc). When applied to a thrown weapon, the weapon returns automatically to the wielder’s hand after being thrown.\r\n\r\nSerrated blade (1,000 gc). A bladed weapon can be serrated, rendering the sharp edge jagged. While this makes the weapon less useful for single cuts, it makes wounds much more cruel as the jagged edges are dragged across the target, causing an additional +1d6 damage. A serrated blade cannot be sharpened, however, and any abilities which improve weapon quality through maintenance or sharpening do not work with it.\r\n\r\nSharpened (1,000 gc). Most blades are sharp, but some are razor sharp. A sharpened blade automatically inflicts the Bleeding condition, even if a critical hit is not achieved.\r\n\r\nSlayer (5,000 gc). The weapon is designed to destroy a specific creature type. Choose one, such as fey, goblinoids, reptiles, etc. That creature type cannot wield the weapon (and will suffer 1d6 damage every turn in which it is touching it) and automatically suffers critical hits from it on a successful attack.\r\n\r\nSonic (5,000 gc). The weapon emits an immense crashing sound when it strikes. Its damage type gains the sonic damage type in addition to its regular damage type. The sound is loud enough to be heard for up to a mile. On a critical hit, all within 30' also take 1d6 sonic damage.\r\n\r\nSoulsucker (30,000 gc). A hit from this weapon not only physically harms the victim, but sucks out his very soul. The weapon targets the victim’s CHA dice pool, reducing it by one die with every successful hit. If the target’s CHA dice pool reaches 0d6, his soul is transferred to the weapon and consumed, and the victim dies. Many weapons with this property also have the malice property, making them truly malignant items.\r\n\r\nSpellbreaker (2,500 gc). The weapon can smite magical effects, ending them. When it scores a hit on an enchanted creature or object, a MAG vs. MAG opposed check is made. If the weapon wins, the target’s enchantment ends. The MAG dice pool of the weapon is 5d6; that of the target is the MAG pool of the caster of the enchantment. If the enchantment is a temporary one, it is ended immediately; if it is a permanent one, it is suppressed for one hour. This enchantment can be added multiple times; every time beyond the first adds +1d6 to the weapon’s MAG pool.\r\n\r\nSummoning (20,000 gc). A summoning enchantment allows the owner to speak the name of the weapon and call it to his hand as a free action from a distance of up to one mile. Taking this enchantment a second time (this costs 30,000 additional gc) makes the owner able to summon it from any distance. This property can be used once per day.\r\n\r\nQuillon/Guard (200 gc). The handle of the weapon can have a hand guard added to it; or, if there is already one, the existing guard can be enlarged or strengthened. This enhancement grants the wielder +1 Melee Defense. If the weapon already grants such a bonus, it stacks with this additional bonus.\r\n\r\nUnerring (10,000 gc). This enchantment is applied to an arrow or thrown weapon. It always hits its target as long as it is within one range increment. However, when using this property of the weapon, dice cannot be paid for additional effects.\r\n\r\nVenom groove (2,500 gc). A slashing or piercing melee weapon can have a groove cut into it into which poison or venom can be delivered via a small container. The toxic agent adds the poison type to the weapon’s damage (an arrow so customized dealspiercing and poison damage). The container must be refilled (takes one minute) after each use.\r\n\r\nWarning (750 gc). The weapon can warn of the presence of a selected creature type. Typically it does so with a soft glow, but alternatively it may do so with an audible hum or other signal. The range of the detection is 30', but if the enchantment is applied twice it becomes 100'. A third time extends the range to one mile.\r\n\r\nWilful (35,000 gc). A wilful weapon is intelligent. It can speak or whisper telepathically to its owner, and has its own agenda and desires which are established at the time of enchantment. Once per day it can attempt to take control of its owner for one minute by making an opposed check vs. its wielder’s WIL dice pool. The weapon’s CHA dice pool for this purpose is 5d6. This enchantment can be added multiple times; every time beyond the first adds +1d6 to the weapon’s CHA pool. These weapons may be good or evil.\r\n\r\nWorthy (5,000 gc). The weapon can only be wielded by those who meet a criteria set by the enchanter. This may be a specific person, or someone who meets a condition. Those who do not meet the criteria are unable to lift or move the weapon.",

          "Markdown": "# Felan\r\n\r\nFelan are feline scavengers and merchants. Cat-like humanoids, Felans are shorter and slimmer than Humans, fur-covered, with feline features. Felan fur coloring varies as much as does that of domestic cats, from jet black through browns, grays, whites, and mixes thereof.\r\n\r\nFelans, unimaginatively named by the first human explorers to encounter them, are a cat-like species. Like their four-legged namesake, Felans are often beautiful to the eye, and move with a graceful, acrobatic purpose. Easily able to jump and climb, Felans like to make use of their environment, and tend to sleep in precarious locations high above the ground.\r\n\r\nFelans enter adulthood early, as 12 years of age, and reach old age at 30 years.\r\n\r\nFelans have a deserved reputation for being easily distracted, and often flit from career to career, unable  to settle.\r\n\r\n## Statistics\r\n\r\nSize/type: Medium; humanoid\r\n\r\nAttributes: AGI +2, INT +1, CHA +1, LUC +1\r\n\r\nSkill choices: acrobatics, climbing, jumping, [unarmed fighting], reactions, appraisal, bluffing, stealth, negotiating\r\n\r\n## Exploits\r\n\r\n- Fast. Felans are fast and nimble, adding 2 to their SPEED.\r\n- Jumper. Felans are adept at jumping, adding 5' to both horizontal and vertical jump distances.\r\n- Land On Your Feet. When falling (or jumping down), a Felan reduces the effective distance by half.\r\n- Claws. Accurately slashing with their sharp claws, a Felan’s unarmed damage is 2d6 slashing damage.\r\n- Agile. Felans are noted for their dexterity. When taking a new career, a Felan may optionally exchange one of the listed four attribute increases for AGI, as long as it doesn’t result in a duplicate attribute advancement.\r\n- Short-lived. When creating a Felan character, halve all career durations, rounding up.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/h0zLF41ulNgs5Vt4MLbdNsac6VBuwbQ_Nm0Rf1emw1i8lFiIkgx6RfMcTRLvSnO_PxqcddXn0rOsphcnwGDas5QEwW9gkr6q53QltG764BSzIR4h=w1280)",

Lighter suits, known as **platemail**, have fewer plates and use chainmail in the gaps. The plates of plate armor are carefully articulated, allowing for surprising flexibility. Higher quality plate armor is often fitted to the wearer, although largely restricted to the wealthy and jousters. Plate armor sometimes incorporates “pieces of exchange” - parts which can be switched out for different purposes. Like most metal armor, it does not protect against electricity damage.\r\n\r\nSOAK 10 | Type heavy | Weight 70 lb\r\n\r\nAdd To Cart",

          "Markdown": "# Future Armor Customizations\r\n\r\nAugmented Reaction (1,000cr). This functionality can only be built into medium or heavy armor, and includes a heads-up-display, proximity alert systems, and other electronic devices designed to improve the reaction time of the wearer. Augmented reaction armor grants a +1d6 bonus to Initiative checks.\r\n\r\nAblative (500cr). Highly effective, ablative armor absorbs damage by vaporizing when hit. Ablative armor starts with 2 additional points of SOAK. Its SOAK value reduces by 1 point with each hit, and the actual weight of the armor lessens by 5lb.\r\n\r\nCloak (10,000cr). Cloaking technology is expensive and uncommon. It renders the wearer almost invisible (+3d6 bonus to checks made to hide), although a perceptive viewer can make out a slight shimmering.\r\n\r\nGravitic (4,000cr). Gravitic armor is used in high, low or zero gravity situations using artificial gravity field generators. The wearer of gravitic armor is unaffected by zero, high, or low gravity.\r\n\r\nKinetic (1,000cr). Kinetic armor is able to sense when the wearer is in free-fall and reduce his falling speed to ensure a gentle landing. The wearer does not take falling damage, but must still make an AGILITY check to land on his feet.\r\n\r\nReflective (400cr). Reflective armor is a cheap, efficient way to deflect beam weapons. However, it is highly visible, and not suitable for stealth-based operations. Reflective armor grants 5 SOAK vs. heat damage, but inflicts a -2d6 penalty to checks made to hide. Reflective armor cannot be combined with camouflage or chameleon properties.\r\n\r\nSilent (2,000cr). Silent suits add sonic dampening technology in the form of miniature field generators. These field generators cannot be used on heavy armor. Silent suits grant a +1d6 bonus to AGILITY checks to be stealthy, and – as a side-effect – provide 5 SOAK vs. sonic damage.\r\n\r\nSpikes (80cr). This medieval looking adjustment looks intimidating and exotic; however, their primary purpose is to cause damage to opponents who attempt to grab the wearer. Any attempt to grab the wearer of spiked armor causes the attacker 1d6 piercing damage.\r\n\r\nThermal (250cr). Thermal armor both protects against cold environments, and also grants 5 SOAK vs. cold (cryo) damage.\r\n\r\nCamouflage (300cr). Camouflage armor is an easy and cheap way to blend into the surroundings. Camouflage can be applied to any armor, and must be selected for a specific terrain (desert, snow, jungle, night). Wearing the correct camouflage armor for the terrain grants a +1d6 bonus to checks to hide. This does not stack with the chameleon property.\r\n\r\nChameleon (5,000cr). The ultimate in camouflage, chameleon armor uses nanotechnology to rapidly change color to react to its environment. Chameleon armor grants a +2d6 bonus to checks to hide. This does not stack with the camouflage property.\r\n\r\nNanorepair (5,000cr). Nanorepair armor is able to repair itself, and is especially useful when combined with ablative armor. It repairs itself by 1 point every turn.\r\n\r\nThrusters (5,000cr). Thrusters built into heavy armors can enable spectacular jumps. With an action, the wearer can safely jump 30’ up or across with no attribute check required.",

          "Markdown": "# Future Weapon Customizations\r\n\r\nAccelerated (10,000cr). An accelerated weapon is one which is designed with special materials and even warping technology to allow the user to strike faster with it. These weapons are always melee weapons, and the user gains an additional free attack with the weapon if he has already attacked twice with it this turn.\r\n\r\nAmmunition booster (500cr). An ammunition boost refers to actual ammo, power cells, or charges. The ammunition boost doubles the capacity of the weapon.\r\n\r\nBio-active (1,500cr). Bio-active weaponry is the far future equivalent of poisoned darts. Biological warfare, while disdained, is not uncommon. A bio-active weapon (either melee or ranged) is designed to emit small amounts of bioactive material onto the ammunition or striking edge of the weapon. Only weapons which fire bullets, or melee weapons which do slashing or piercing damage qualify for a bioactive upgrade. The bio-active agent adds the poison damage type to the weapon’s damage (e.g. changing a pistol to ballistic/poison damage.)\r\n\r\nBooby trapped (1,000cr). A booby trapped weapon will explode, shock, or otherwise harm the wielder if an unauthorized user attempts to use it. There are two levels of booby trap – manual activation (which requires the authorized user to enter a code to activate the weapon safely) or ID Matched activation (which automatically recognizes an authorized user).\r\n\r\nManual activation: manually activating a booby trapped weapon requires an action. Attempting to use the weapon without activating it will trigger the booby trap.\r\n\r\nID Matched activation: the weapon must also have the ID Matched upgrade applied to it. No action is required to use activate the weapon. Unauthorized users will automatically trigger the booby trap.\r\n\r\nThe trigger for a booby trapped weapon is an attempt to use. In the case of a firearm, it is use of the trigger; with a laser sword or other similar technological melee device, it is the power control. There are two common types of booby trap available:\r\n\r\nExplosive: the weapon explodes. It causes 2d6 heat damage to the user (large weapons cause 3d6 heat damage). The weapon is destroyed.\r\n\r\nShock: the weapon gives the user an electric shock. The user takes 2d6 electricity damage and drops the weapon.\r\n\r\nCombined weapon (price varies). A combined weapon is one which incorporates the features of one or more weapons. This could be as simple as a rifle with a bayonet (spear) on the end or a weapon with an inbuilt grenade launcher. Highly advanced weapons might include the features of multiple weapons, able to access each on command.\r\n\r\nA combined weapon costs the price of each of its component weapons multiplied by the number of component weapons. Each component must be of the same quality; you cannot combine an exceptional quality with an artisanal quality weapon – they are incompatible.\r\n\r\nYou are able to switch between the different modes of a weapon as a free action in your turn, though you may only do so once per turn.\r\n\r\nHigh damage (1,000cr). The weapon has been modified to make it more deadly. Perhaps a baseball bat has spikes on it, or a firearm uses an advanced propellant. It does +1d6 damage.\r\n\r\nID-matched (500cr). An ID-Matched weapon can only be used by a single designated individual – usually its owner. The system uses a variety of biometric data to determine the user’s identity and will not function for any wielder other than that individual. This upgrade cannot be applied to simple weapons like clubs or swords; the weapon must have electronic components which require activation. An ID-Matched weapon can also be Booby Trapped; this is a separate upgrade.\r\n\r\nMiniaturized (2,000cr). A miniaturized weapon is a very compact, easily concealable version of a weapon. Only ranged weapons can be miniaturized in this fashion (melee weapons lose their damage dealing capacity by miniaturizing them). A miniaturized weapon is reduced by two size categories (minimum is tiny), and inflicts a -2d6 penalty on anyone searching the owner for it. Its capabilities are not affected in any other way.\r\n\r\nPhasing (12,000cr). A phasing weapon uses high advanced transporter technology to negate cover. A microchip calculates the exact moment to phase the ammunition to the other side of a barrier. This can only be applied to ranged weapons which fire projectiles. The weapon ignores any cover penalties to hit the target within the first range increment, once per round only.\r\n\r\nScope (100cr). A scope is one of the most basic, common additions to a ranged weapon. It enables the wielder to more easily hit targets at greater range increments. A scope adds 50% to the range increment of a ranged weapon.\r\n\r\nAdvanced scope: an advanced scope (500cr) adds 100% to the weapon’s range increment instead of 50%.\r\n\r\nNight scope: a night scope (300cr) allows the user to operate a ranged weapon in complete darkness.\r\n\r\nSeeker (15,000cr). A seeking weapon is a highly advanced piece of technology. Integrated computer chips with enhanced target-finding AI instantaneously calculate the exact distance and direction of the target. Seeking weapons grant a +2d6 bonus to attack rolls with a ranged weapon above and beyond that granted by the weapon’s innate quality. However, they can only be fired once per round.\r\n\r\nStealthy (500cr). A stealthy weapon is one composed of materials which do not register on security scanners. The weapon will not, however, bypass a visual inspection.\r\n\r\nSuppressor (250cr). A suppressor is used to silence or muffle a weapon by emitting a frequency-calculated sonic pulse designed to nullify the weapon’s own noise. Any weapon with a suppressor attached emits no sound when used. A sonic weapon with a suppressor is rendered nonfunctional.\r\n\r\nTransporting (20,000cr). A transporting weapon is able to be called to the user’s hand. The basic type of transporting weapon must be stored in a special permanent unit on a starship or in a building, and is recalled using a special glove. The range is 1 mile. Recalling the weapon is an action.\r\n\r\nA more advanced transporting weapon contains its own transporting unit and can be concealed anywhere. This upgrade is more expensive, however, costing 50,000cr.",

Contingencies cost half the usual cost for the spell’s duration. For example, casting a spell on yourself which lasts 1 day would normally attract a duration cost of 6 MP. If it held a contingency trigger (e.g. a teleport which whisks you to safety if you fall below half Health), that duration would cost 3 MP instead. Contingencies are often used for alarms and similar spells. The contingency must be precisely specified and cannot require knowledge that would not be available.\r\n\r\nConditions. Cost 2–4 MP.

Their jagged, yellow teeth are suited to tearing meat apart, and their yellow eyes are suited to seeing in the darkness of deep caverns and caves.\r\n\r\n## Statistics\r\n\r\nSize: Small; fey humanoid\r\n\r\nAttributes: AGI +2, INT +2\r\n\r\nSkill Choices: thievery, climbing, stealth, survival, mining, running, knives.\r\n\r\n## Exploits\r\n\r\n- Pack attack. Goblins work best in groups, using numbers to compensate for their small size. Goblins gain +1d6 to attack a target for every ally also adjacent to the target.\r\n- Darksight. Goblins can see in darkness as though it were normal light. They are vulnerable to bright light, however, and lose their Natural Cunning ability in direct sunlight, and cannot shake off the Blind status if it is caused by bright light (note that temporary conditions automatically end after 5 minutes).\r\n- Natural cunning.

Their ears are pointed, and their faces tend towards the angular. They are immortal, and do not age past middle-age, although can still be slain by accident, illness, or violence.\r\n\r\nMusic is important to Grand Elves.

When taking a new career, a Grand Elf character may exchange one of the listed attribute increases for MAG, as long as this doesn’t result in duplicate advancement.\r\n- Meditation. Grand Elves do not need to sleep. They may sometimes choose to meditate, instead, while their non-elven companions are sleeping, but this is not necessary.\r\n- Natural Magic.

Healing spells affecting objects are called mending spells. Depending on what enhancements you purchase, a healing spell can cure damage, repair injuries such as blindness or lost limbs, or restore life energy by allaying exhaustion and other conditions.\r\n\r\nA healing cantrip can heal 1 point of Health, but a given target can only benefit from this once per day.\r\n\r\n## Healing\r\n\r\nCure Wounds. Cost 1 MP; 2 MP per +1d6 Health. All Heal spells restore a base 1d6 points of Health to all in the spell’s area if you spend 1 MP. You can increase this healing to 2d6 by spending 2 MP instead, and thereafter by an additional 1d6 for each further 2 MP you spend. Remember that a given creature can only benefit from the same source of healing once per day; this enhancement counts as a single source of healing.\r\n\r\nRegenerate. Cost 12 MP. The spell regenerates lost body parts no larger than a limb. This is proportional to the creature being healed, and can heal a giant as easily as a pixie.\r\n\r\nResurrection. Cost 18 MP. The spell restores to life a creature that has died in the past day. The creature returns with 0 Health, but stabilized. For 25 MP, there is no time limit on how long ago the creature died, as long as it did not die of old age.\r\n\r\n## Mending\r\n\r\nMend Objects. Cost 1 MP per 2 Health. The spell mends Health damage in objects at a rate of 2 Health for each MP spent.\r\n\r\nPurify Food. Cost 1 MP. You can make up to four pounds of food and drink safe to ingest. This does not neutralize poison already in creatures or on weapons.\r\n\r\n## Conditions & Diseases\r\n\r\nRemove Condition. Cost 1 or 2 MP. You remove one condition from the target. For 1 MP you remove a standard condition; for 2 MP you remove a severe condition.\r\n\r\nSlow Disease. Cost 5 MP. You add one countdown dice to the target’s disease countdown pool. A patient can only benefit from this once per day.\r\n\r\nCure Disease. Cost 9 MP. You completely cure one disease, removing it entirely from your target.\r\n\r\nSlow Poison. Cost 2 MP. For the spell’s duration, poison in the area of effect has no effect. Once the spell elapses, poison takes its usual course.\r\n\r\nNegate Poison. Cost 5 MP. The spell neutralizes poison in the area. Any poison that enters the area during the spell’s duration is permanently neutralized. Creatures with natural poison abilities are subject to an attack which neutralizes their venom for the duration if successful.",

The lower a character’s HEALTH score, the closer to unconsciousness and death that character is. Any attack can cause damage, and this damage is deducted directly from the target’s Health score. When HEALTH is zero or lower, the character is unconscious and in danger of death.\n\n## Zero HEALTH\n\nWhen a character is reduced to zero HEALTH or lower, he immediately forms a countdown dice pool equal in size to her ENDURANCE dice pool. This dice pool represents the clock ticking down as he slides towards death. Every time his turn comes around, he throws the dice pool once. Any dice which come up 6 get removed from the pool. When he has no dice left, he dies.\n\nEach time an unconscious character takes additional damage, one die is removed from the dice pool. The amount of damage does not make any difference.\n\n## Recovery\n\nOnce per day, typically after a night’s sleep, a character may spend one hour to recover HEALTH. The amount recovered is equal to one roll of her END dice pool.\n\nHEALTH can also be recovered in other ways. Certain drugs and career exploits can grant the ability to heal other creatures or regain one’s own HEALTH.\n\n## First Aid\n\nWhen a character is at zero HEALTH or less, anybody can attempt to perform emergency healing (first aid). First aid is applied to a patient which has been reduced to zero HEALTH or lower, and takes two actions. To perform emergency healing, simply make a LOG check (with dice pool contributions from relevant skills and equipment) equal to the negative HEALTH value of the patient (with a minimum difficulty of Routine [10]). If successful, the patient is stabilized and the death pool stops ticking. The patient will, of course, still be at negative HEALTH at this point, and some way to restore HEALTH will be required.\n\nAny further damage that day restarts the death countdown at the point where it was stabilized. Characters can receive frst aid multiple times per day, but the size of the countdown pool does not reset until they have had a full night's rest.",

A hex is essentially a curse. A hex cantrip can inflict a –1 penalty to all Defense scores for up to one round.\r\n\r\nAttracting. Cost 2 MP per 1 Defense. The target attracts attacks, which are diverted towards the target. Affected creatures take a penalty to their Defense equal to half the MP spent.\r\n\r\nBinding. Cost 3 MP. The opposite of Hedging is called Binding. It traps creatures within a given area, following the same rules as hedging. The binding also includes dimensional movement, so the creature cannot teleport out. If the creature is not entirely inside the area of effect when the spell takes effect, it is not bound. If a creature attacks or otherwise deals damage to the bound creature, it is free to retaliate, but is still bound spatially. If the caster attacks the bound creature, it is freed entirely from the binding.\r\n\r\nBinding, Enduring. Cost 6 MP. As Binding, but affected creatures get only one chance per day to bypass the barrier. Of course, if the duration is less than a day, this benefit is slightly reduced.\r\n\r\nBinding, Greater. Cost 5 MP. As Binding, but none of the bound creature’s attacks, spells, or abilities can cross the area of effect.\r\n\r\nCurse. Cost varies. You inflict the Cursed condition. The standard condition costs 2 MP, while the extreme condition costs 4 MP. The condition is a temporary one which can be shaken off normally; however, you can make it persistent by doubling this enhancement’s MP cost.\r\n\r\nVulnerability. Cost 4 MP per 1d6 vulnerability. The target becomes vulnerable to one damage type. For every 4 MP spent, the target’s vulnerability increases by 1d6. The caster may choose any single damage type.",

          "Markdown": "# Illusion Enhancements\r\n\r\nIllusion magic is a little different from other magical skills. Unlike those, illusion magic requires no secret— it is the art of deception and fakery. It may mimic a secret, but it is not real. For this reason, these spells are cast without an associated secret, and are available to any with the illusion skill.\r\n\r\nYou create some sort of sensory illusion, which can be any size up to the size of the area of effect. An illusion can create an image or hide something (invisibility). Invisibility is basically a visual illusion of nothingness.\r\n\r\nOnce you set the illusion, it remains the same. If you are within range, you can spend an action concentrating to make slight changes to the illusion or move it, but the general theme must remain the same, and the illusion cannot move beyond the area of effect. You can automatically disbelieve this illusion if you want.\r\n\r\nThe basic cost of an illusion is determined by its size (the area of effect that comprises the illusion) plus a modifier for its quality. You can build the illusion out of various sensory components.\r\n\r\n## Disbelief\r\n\r\nIllusions do not require an attack roll against creatures, but a Magic check should be rolled to determine the quality of the illusion. If a creature has reason to suspect an illusion is not real, it can make an opposed INT check vs. the pre-rolled Magic check to discern its true nature. If a creature receives actual proof that an illusion is not real (an ally falls through an illusory wall, for example, or an invisible creature attacks the observer), it automatically disbelieves it. Disbelieving an illusion does not remove it; disbelief merely makes its illusory nature apparent to the viewer.\r\n\r\n## Bundled Senses\r\n\r\nWhen combining multiple illusion types (visual, olfactory, audio, etc.) you can “bundle” the effects to save some MP, as each reinforces the others and helps mask imperfections. Each sense beyond the first is discounted by 1 MP, to a minimum of 1 MP.\r\n\r\n## Notes on Invisibility\r\n\r\nInvisibility is a complex visual illusion. Camouflage can be achieved with a simple illusion (+1d6 to attempts at stealth), and a weak invisibility effect which has a visible distortion effect is an average illusion (+2d6 attempts at stealth). Full invisibility as a complex illusion gives +3d6 to stealth attempts and, of course, renders the target completely invisible (a failed stealth attempt or a disbelieved invisibility illusion—such as if the invisible creature attacks the observer—means that the viewer knows where the invisible creature is due to other clues—sound, moving items, tracks, being stabbed in the face, etc. but can’t actually see it).\r\n\r\nOther illusions which mask various senses contribute to invisibility. An illusion that masks all five senses makes the target completely undetectable by normal means: a creature so well concealed doesn't need to roll stealth checks.\r\n\r\nAn illusion cantrip can create a small, clearly illusory effect for up to one round.\r\n\r\n## Sound\r\n\r\nAudio Illusion, Average. Cost 3 MP. Creating an average sound can make noise as loud as a small crowd of shouting men, with one or two articulate sounds. Thus, you could have a simple song with a few instruments, or a conversation. Hiding an average sound can make a roar sound like a soft quack, make one conversation sound like a different one, or reduce the volume by a substantial amount (granting +1d6 to stealth attempts).\r\n\r\nAudio Illusion, Complex. Cost 5 MP. A complex sound can be as loud as a dragon’s roar or an entire parade cheering, and all of it can be as articulate as you want, complete with subtle sounds like kids in the crowd whining to their moms, and the dragon’s roar echoing properly in an opera house. Hiding a complex sound lets you turn any noise into practically anything else of the same volume or quieter. Complete silence is a complex audio illusion which grants +2d6 to stealth attempts.\r\n\r\nAudio Illusion, Simple. Cost 1 MP. Creating a simple sound could create any simple repeating sound, like a growl, laughter, or moan of wind, but nothing articulate. The volume can be no louder than four men talking. Hiding a simple sound could make speech sound like an indistinct murmur, or reduce the volume of a sound slightly.\r\n\r\n## Smell\r\n\r\nOlfactory Illusion, Average. Cost 3 MP. An average olfactory illusion could make the air smell like warm root beer, or make an illusory steak taste real. Hiding an average olfactory sensation would let you fool the scent and taste buds of any human except the finest connoisseurs, and could throw animals off your trail.\r\n\r\nOlfactory Illusion, Complex. Cost 6 MP. A complex olfactory illusion can be whatever you want, as complicated and subtle as you like. Similarly, hiding a complex olfactory sensation would let you turn any taste or smell into anything else that isn’t very much more or less strong.\r\n\r\nOlfactory Illusion, Simple. Cost 1 MP. Creating a simple olfactory sensation can fake intense smells, like blood, sour milk, or ammonia. Hiding a simple olfactory sensation lets you conceal the distinct stench of rotting zombies, or hide your own body odor, but the new smell would be bland.\r\n\r\n## Touch\r\n\r\nTactile Illusion, Average. Cost 4 MP. An average tactile sensation could make someone feel they’re being jostled by invisible people, or give a visual illusion of a cat a real texture. Hiding an average tactile sensation would let you make blood gushing from a wound feel like worms crawling across you, and could make a suit of armor feel like a fine royal robe.\r\n\r\nTactile Illusion, Complex. Cost 8 MP. Creating a complex tactile sensation would let you make a person feel like he’s on fire, and would put the finishing touches on an illusion of a beautiful nymph: warm, wet, and covered in fine sand particles from the bank of a stream. Hiding a complex tactile sensation would let you make a real object feel like it is intangible, and could turn a lover’s embrace into the segmented coils of a demon leech.\r\n\r\nTactile Illusion, Simple. Cost 2 MP. Creating a simple tactile sensation could make the air feel moist and heavy, or make you feel wet. Hiding a simple tactile sensation could make glass feel like sandpaper, give metal a wood grain, or make a fire feel cold. Hiding a tactile sensation won’t stop a person from feeling pain, but it might confuse him as to how to avoid the injury.\r\n\r\n## Sight\r\n\r\nVisual Illusion, Average. Cost 3 MP. Creating an average visual would let you create a bookshelf with a lot of books that look generally the same, make a ghostly glowing word appear in the air, or create a convincing orc warrior (though if you made several orc warriors, they’d all look alike). Hiding an average visual would allow you to blur your own image as you move, change the appearance of one person to resemble another person, or make an immobile object invisible.\r\n\r\nVisual Illusion, Complex. Cost 5 MP. Creating a complex visual would let you make any sort of visual image, no matter how fine the details are.\r\n\r\nYou could make the illusion of a full person, complete with distinctive markings, unique pieces of clothing, and an expressive demeanor. Hiding a complex visual can make things invisible even while moving, make a group of sneaking goblins look like harmless ducks, or make a worthless rock look like an ornate bejeweled porcelain egg. Attacks against a blurred creature have a –1d6 die penalty. Attacks against an invisible creature have a –2d6 die penalty.\r\n\r\nVisual Illusion, Simple. Cost 1 MP. Creating a simple visual would let you make a fairly drab set of clothes, a wall with a repeating pattern of tiles, or a very rough approximation of a living creature. Hiding a simple visual would let you replace a complicated image with a simple one, like hiding a scar with smooth skin, hiding a secret door with flat stone, or turning an elaborate tapestry into a mono-color rug.\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n\r\nAura Illusion. Cost 3 MP. An aura illusion enables you to create a fake magical aura, or to mask an existing aura.\r\n\r\nReactive Illusion. Cost 4 MP. You can make your illusion react on its own. For example, normally, you could have an illusion of a guard standing watch, shifting occasionally in his stance and appearing to breathe, but not reacting to anyone else. With a simple reactive illusion, the guard would look at and glower slightly at anyone who came by. A standard reactive illusion would let the guard respond to questions with disinterest. A complex reactive illusion would let the guard act exactly as you would want it to if you were there to direct it consciously.",

          "Markdown": "# Infliction Enhancements\r\n\r\nInflict [element]\r\n\r\nInfliction spells are the reverse of infusion spells. An infliction spell saps a creature, reducing its attributes or other aspects or causing disease.\r\n\r\nInflict spells can also cause the following conditions: Blind, Deaf, Fatigued, Pain, Poisoned, Sick.\r\n\r\nAn inflict cantrip can cause a feeling of slight nausea for up to one minute.\r\n\r\nAffliction. Cost varies. You inflict one of the allowed conditions (listed above). A standard condition costs 2 MP, while a severe condition costs 4 MP. The secret needed for the spell depends on the associated element (see the Elements by Attribute table, above). The condition is a temporary one which can be shaken off normally; however, you can make it persistent by doubling this enhancement’s MP cost.\r\n\r\nAge. Cost 1 MP per 5 years. You must use the secret of death to age a victim. You increase the recipient creature’s age. The effect lasts for the duration of the spell, but should it cause death, the death is permanent. This enhancement does not affect creatures that don’t age, like undead or constructs. This cannot affect objects.\r\n\r\nCause Disease. Cost varies. You must use the secret of death to inflict disease upon a target. Diseases can be inflicted upon victims. Select one disease. The MP cost of the spell is equal to half the difficulty value of the disease itself. Recovering from a disease requires use of the countdown rules.

These spells are used to grant strength, resilience, or even charisma to the target. The recipient of an infusion spell detects the appropriate element or virtue for purposes of divination and is affected as though it were of that element or virtue (for example, when affected by abjuration or healing spells).\r\n\r\nAn infuse cantrip can cause a creature to detect as the appropriate virtue or element for up to one round.\r\n\r\nEnhance Attribute.

However, it is not a subsitute for the actual rulebooks, and lacks much of the descriptive or contextual text which accompanies the rules. For this reason, it may be difficult to learn the rules only using this document.\r\n\r\n## Equipment\r\n\r\nEquipment and starships are found separately on the [WOINGEAR website](http://www.woingear.com).",

          "Markdown": "# LUCK\n\nLUCK is a special attribute. It is used as a replenishable resource which can modify other die rolls and perform special actions. It represents luck, fate, chance, destiny faith, divine favor, karma, and more. Luck can be interpreted in any way by characters and creatures who use it. For some, it is merely coincidence and serendipity; for others it represents cool and mojo; while for still others it may be divine in origin, representing faith and blessings. However the character interprets the concept of luck, it is used in the same way.\n\nEach player should form a LUCK dice pool.  As dice are used from the LUCK pool, simply discard them.  LUCK can be used to:\n\n1. Add dice to any attribute check on a 1:1 basis.\n2. Deduct dice from someone else's attribute check on a 1:1 basis.\n3. Absorb damage on a 1:1 basis (roll as many LUC dice as you wish, and deduct the total from the damage).\n4. Add dice to a damage roll on a 1:1 basis.\n5. Gain one bonus action per turn by spending a LUC die. This can only happen during a character’s own turn.\n6. Ignore an inflicted temporary condition as a reaction to the effect which causes it.\n7. Perform other special actions granted by careers and exploits.\n\nLUC dice can only be used within an encounter; you cannot use LUC dice during downtime, or on daily checks. And the GM should disallow the use of LUC if she feels that a player is simply blowing all their LUCk on a check because it’s the only one they’ll make that day. In game terms, being able to invest all your LUC in one go makes sense only if you’ve had, or will have, a number of other chances to be unlucky in the day (you’ve either saved up a lucky moment or will have a chance to “pay it back”).\n\n## Exploding Dice\n\nLUCK dice \"explode\".  This means that whenever a 6 is rolled, the die is rolled again and the new roll added to the original 6.  This process is repeated if subsequent 6s are rolled. It is recommended that LUCK dice be a different color to other dice so that they can be easily distinguished.\n\n## Leadership\n\nThe Leadership exploit allows you to donate your LUC dice to others. Without this exploit, you may only spend LUC on yourself. Characters with the Leadership exploit may donate one or more of their available LUC dice to another character as a free reaction to their attempting an attribute check. You must declare this before the ally rolls their check.\n\n## Replenishing LUCK\n\nOnce per day, a character may replenish his LUCK pool. Some careers or traditions allow for an additional replenishment; these do not stack, and you cannot gain more than one additional daily replenishment.\n\n## Other Uses of LUCK\n\nOther uses of LUCK manipulate situations where the odds are normally even.\n\n1. When determining a 50/50 chance of an outcome, roll a Routine [10] LUCK check instead.  Characters with higher LUCK succeed more often on an ostensibly 50/50 chance.\n2. When randomly determining a PC, have each player roll LUCK.  Either the highest or the lowest wins, depending on the situation.",

          "Markdown": "# Magic\r\n\r\nMagic in the WOIN RPG uses a “verb-noun” system that allows magic-users to devise and cast spells on the fly. For example, a spellcaster might use evoke (verb) fire (noun) to throw a bolt of fire at a foe. The verbs are known as skills, and the nouns are known as secrets. The spellcaster can combine any skills and secrets she knows to cast a spell—enchant beast, move metal, create water, abjure undead, and so on. There are, of course, rules which govern exactly how that spell can manifest itself in terms of range, duration, targets, and other rule mechanics; but the spellcasting system as a whole is incredibly flexible and allows for a vast range of combinations and possibilities limited only by the magic-user’s imagination.\r\n\r\n## Anybody Can Cast Spells\r\n\r\nMagic use isn’t limited solely to specialized spellcasters. While someone who devotes their life to the mage, druid, or other magical careers will undoubtedly far outweigh others in terms of ability, a farmhand can mutter an incantation to help with the crops, a knight can whisper a prayer asking for his god’s guidance, and a woodsman may know a minor healing spell.\r\n\r\nAnybody with the appropriate skill or secret can use a cantrip (a spell with a cost of 0 MP) even if they have no MAGIC attribute; and anybody can have a MAGIC attribute even if they have never taken a magical career.\r\n\r\n- [Magical Glossary](/magic-chi-psionics/magic/magical-glossary)\r\n- [Detecting & Identifying Magic](/magic-chi-psionics/magic/detecting-identifying-magic)\r\n- [Magical Implements](/magic-chi-psionics/magic/magical-implements)\r\n- [Spellcasting Basics](/magic-chi-psionics/magic/spellcasting-basics)\r\n- [Casting A Spell](/magic-chi-psionics/magic/casting-a-spell)\r\n- [Spell Enhancements](/magic-chi-psionics/magic/spell-enhancements)\r\n- [Simplified Magic](/magic-chi-psionics/magic/simplified-magic)",

          "Markdown": "# Magical Glossary\r\n\r\nThe language you use to talk about and define magic is a powerful influence over its flavor in your game. Whether magic is referred to by its practitioners as “Wizardry” or their “Art,” or whether Magic Points are known as mana, energy, faith, or stamina, this terminology helps form our image of how magic is seen and how it works in the world.\r\n\r\nBelow you will find WOIN’s default terminology.\r\n\r\nArt. This is the practice of magic. It is always referred to with an upper-case “A.”\r\n\r\nCareer. Magical careers are areas of study or domain; while WOIN’s core assumption is that there is but one Art, it can be accessed in different ways by different careers.\r\n\r\nMagic Points. Magic points, or MP, are the expendable reservoir from which a magic-user draws magical power. A magic-user’s total MP is equal to three times her Magic attribute.\r\n\r\nMagic Skills. Magic skills include types of magic such as abjuration, summoning, healing, and so on. Not only do these skills grant access to specific forms of magic, but higher ranks in those skills grant access to more complex and powerful enhancements.\r\n\r\nMagic-User. This is a practitioner of magic, whether a studious mage, a devout cleric, a foul necromancer, or a nature-loving druid.\r\n\r\nSecrets. Secrets are the keys to “things” in the world. The secret of fire, for example, gives you access to fire magic. Careers grant specific secrets. Secrets are like true names, and are sometimes referred to as such; once you know the true name, or secret, of an element or creature, you gain power over it.\r\n\r\nSpellcraft. Spellcraft is the academic understanding of magic. It is not the use of magic itself; it is knowledge about magic, its history, its signs, and so on. Spellcraft is a category including a number of magic skills (see above).",

These implements are the basic equipment for a magic-user in the same way that a sword is the basic equipment of a knight. The magical implement forms the “equipment” part of a spellcaster’s dice pool.\r\n\r\nThese implements typically come in the form of staves, orbs, wands, and holy symbols, and apply to any spell the wielder casts while using the implement. Implements also store bonus MP that can be spent while casting a spell.\r\n\r\nImplement \tCost (gc) \tMP\r\n\r\nHoly symbol \t20 \t\t\t12\r\n\r\nOrb \t\t\t250 \t\t24\r\n\r\nStaff \t\t\t500 \t\t36\r\n\r\nWand \t\t\t50 \t\t\t12\r\n\r\nNote that a caster still cannot cast a spell that costs more MP than her Magic attribute.\r\n\r\nImplements function as equipment as normal, granting dice to a dice pool based on quality, on any spells the wielder casts (not just those which use the item’s MP reservoir). The cost of an implement is affected by its quality level as normal.\r\n\r\n## Recharging Implements\r\n\r\nImplements fully recharge their MP at dawn each day.\r\n\r\n## Attunement\r\n\r\nA creature can be attuned to only one implement at a time.

Choose any three soft exploits from the Universal Exploits for Martial Artists sidebar.\r\n- Improved throw (requires Throw). Your throwing distance increases by 5' and deals +1d6 damage.\r\n- Reactive lock (requires Arm Lock).

You may use your martial arts skill with swords, knives, and staves.\r\n\r\n## Brazilian Jujutsu [1d6 years]\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: martial arts.\r\n\r\nAttributes: STR +1, AGI +1, END +1, REP +1\r\n\r\nSkill choices: acrobatics, meditation, martial arts\r\n\r\nTaking your opponents down with expert technique and leverage, you take them to the ground, where you are a master combatant.\r\n\r\n- Ground fighter. Opponents do not gain a bonus to hit you in melee when you are prone.\r\n- Momentous knockdown (requires Knockdown). You do not pay a dice cost to perform the Knockdown exploit; however both you and the target are prone after a successful attempt.\r\n- Forced submission (requires Arm Lock). If both you and your target are prone, and you have successfully applied an Arm Lock, you may make a melee attack against his MENTAL DEFENSE to force him to submit. If successful, your target is reduced to zero HEALTH but does not fall unconscious.\r\n- Escape. When pinned, locked, or held by another combatant, you may use a reaction to make an immediate attempt to escape the pin.\r\n\r\n## Capoeira [1d6 years]\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: dancing, martial arts.\r\n\r\nAttributes: AGI +1, INT +1, LUC +1, CHI +1\r\n\r\nSkill choices: acrobatics, dancing, jumping, reactions, martial arts\r\n\r\nTraining with a capoeira master, you’ve become more adept at the acrobatic martial art, able to tumble, cartwheel, and flip around your enemies with ease.\r\n\r\n- Curriculum exploits. Choose any three hard exploits from the Universal Exploits for Martial Artists sidebar.\r\n- Ginga. You gain +2 to your DEFENSE attribute against melee attacks.\r\n- Asymmetric advantage. If you are engaged in melee with two or more opponents, you gain +1d6 to attack for every two opponents actively engaging you in melee combat. In other words, if you are being attacked by four foes, you gain +2d6 to attack.\r\n- Rasteira (requires Trip). If an adjacent enemy makes a movement action, you may take a trip attack against them as a reaction.\r\n- Asymmetric adept (requires Asymmetric advantage). For every foe past the first, you gain +1 MELEE DEFENSE.\r\n- Roda. Capoeira works better to music. When music is playing publicly, you can make an additional unarmed attack per round as a free action. You cannot attach any exploit to this attack.\r\n- Capoeira weapons.

You may fire firearms with the single trait twice per round instead of once.\r\n- Sliding fusillade. For two actions, you can take your full movement in a straight line and make up to two attack actions.\r\n- Firing forms. By spending all of your actions, you can take as many attack actions as there are targets, up to your INT attribute. You may only fire at a given target once, and each cumulative shot beyond the first takes a -1d6 penalty.\r\n- Leaping ballistics.  When you perform a jump, you may make one gun attack for free.\r\n- Curved bullet. You may spend a LUC die to curve a bullet round a corner once per round, effectively negating your target's cover. You must still have line of sight; this ability negates cover, but does not create new lines of sight.\r\n- Cover me! Any sidearm you use automatically gains the auto trait, making it especially suitable for suppressive fire.\r\n- Dual pistols. You are considered to have the ambidextrous trait while holding two sidearms, even if you do not have that trait.\r\n- When doves fly. Once per day you can cause a number of white doves to fly across the background.\r\n\r\n## Gun Kata [1d6 years]\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: pistols.\r\n\r\nAttributes: AGI +1, INT +1, WIL +1, CHI +1\r\n\r\nSkill choices: pistols, martial arts, acrobatics, reactions, dancing\r\n\r\nYou have learned the unusual but beautiful art of melee gun combat, where the gun is considered a total weapon and katas are performed which statistically inflict the maximum damage on the largest number of targets while avoiding statistically likely trajectories of return fire.\r\n\r\n- Gunpunch. Once per round, while holding a sidearm, your martial arts attack does the damage of your gun.\r\n- Multipunch (requires Gunpunch). If you are dual-wielding pistols, all of your martial arts attacks do the damage of your gun.\r\n- Closedown. When attacked by somebody with a gun 10' or less away from you, you immediately move adjacent to them and perform a martial arts attack as a reaction.\r\n- Bulletcatcher. Once per turn as a reaction you can catch a single bullet fired at you as long as you are aware of the attack. This does not help against weapons with the auto trait.\r\n- Return trajectories. Your skill in pistols can be used as part of your DEFENSE pool against firearms.\r\n- Statistical pose. You are able to adopt positions statistically most unlikely to be struck by gunfire. You gain +4 RANGED DEFENSE against firearms.\r\n\r\n## Jujutsu [1d6 years]\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: martial arts.\r\n\r\nAttributes: STR +1, AGI +1, END +1, CHI +1\r\n\r\nSkill choices: meditation, melee weapon, stealth, martial arts\r\n\r\nTrained in fighting an armed opponent with your feet and fists, you are a fluid warrior in combat, adapting to best use your enemy’s movements against them.\r\n\r\n- Curriculum exploits.

You may use your martial arts skill with swords, spears, polearms, and staves.\r\n\r\n## Karate [1d6 years]\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: martial arts.\r\n\r\nAttributes: STR +1, AGI +1, WIL +1, CHI +1\r\n\r\nSkill choices: meditation, martial arts\r\n\r\nYou learned a striking art which focuses on punches, kicks, and knee and able strikes, as well as open hand strikes.\r\n\r\n- Curriculum exploits. Choose any three hard exploits from the Universal Exploits for Martial Artists sidebar.\r\n- Wax On, Wax Off. You develop patience while performing rote training tasks. You gain +2 MELEE DEFENSE and MENTAL DEFENSE.\r\n- Knifehand strike. You strike with the edge of your hand, stunning your foe with a successful it.\r\n- Crane stance. You adopt a stance by spending an action. You cannot move while in this stance. If any foe attempts to engage you melee combat, you gain a free attack as a reaction against him. This attack takes place before your foe's attack. Once you have made this attack, your stance ends.\r\n- Double punch. You may use one action to make two unarmed attacks against a single foe. You may not add additional exploits to these two attacks.\r\n- Conditioning. Your unarmed attacks do +1d6 damage.\r\n- Karate weapons.

Choose any three hard exploits from the Universal Exploits for Martial Artists sidebar.\r\n- Know the arena. In any location, you automatically note any non-hidden exits from the vicinity. You are easily able to improvise weapons using your surroundings–glasses, rocks, and so on; you always count as carrying a knife or club.\r\n- Brutal counter. After an enemy makes a successful melee attack on you, you gain +1d6 damage in melee against that foe. If any other enemy strikes you, your bonus damage switches to that target.\r\n- Weak points. You are adept at targeting weak or vulnerable points in your foes, and can ignore SOAK by spending one LUC die.\r\n- Impromptu weapon. No matter the size of an impromptu weapon (so long as it is tiny or larger), you can deal slashing, blunt, piercing, or blunt damage with it by making a thrown ranged attack. This does not count as an improvised weapon.\r\n\r\n## Kung Fu [1d6 years]\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: martial arts.\r\n\r\nAttributes: AGI +1, END +1, WIL +1, CHI +1\r\n\r\nSkill choices: acrobatics, meditation, perception, reactions, staves, martial arts\r\n\r\nThrough intense and dedicated training, you've begun to unlock the secrets of the ancient martial arts of China.

Once per day, spend an action to prepare and gain SOAK to one type of damage equal to your CHI for one minute.

Hive trees, conversion factories for the Entity, are protected by mechanical spider-like hunter drones, which also collect victims for the hive trees to convert. Scout drones are smaller explorers, roughly the size of a large cat, which seek viable victims, inject them with a tracking nanite, which the hunter drones use to locate and capture them.\r\n\r\nHive trees are the result of nanite corruption crossing over into plant life. They are used as energy production and storage factories for the machine Entity. Those trees which bear fruit have been converted to a more sinister purpose: supporting cocoons from which the Entity can more efficiently convert other host-species.\r\n\r\nA hive tree resembles its host tree, but its leaves are slicked over with a thin layer of silicate, which act as photovoltaic cells. Power conduits gleam and strobe just beneath the tree’s bark, emitting unsettling flashes, pulses, and streamers of light. The bark is reinforced with thin metallic filaments, which act as a low-grade armor, while leaving the woody bark to act as natural electromagnetic shielding.\r\n\r\nElongated, pulsing sac-like cocoons, dangle from the thicker, lower branches, or bulge, tumor-like, from the girth of the trunk. These cocoons are made of a tough, fibrous material similar to kevlar, but somewhat more transparent. The steady orange-red glow from within is interspersed with twinkling and pulsing lights. The hazy silhouette of whatever creature may be in the process of mechanization can be seen in the murky depths of a cocoon, but exact details can not be made out (perhaps for the best for the casual observer).\r\n\r\nHive trees cannot move, and normally rely on hunter-killers for defense. As a last resort, the hive tree can lash out with its filament-infused vine-like growths. The Entity also uses hive trees to ‘evolve’ drones into either hunters, or hunter-killers if its own full production capabilities are not online.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/n7ilydi4m2tav_gH6uyV-4vx60iRj8NxF9vl_kxuapipBaXrKLhrj7hOIq4LCnWpdB9OUxDAsS6vNVlWVvPQldHlvyk0WT_1ugqsj59Qe6JVwNBp=w1280)\r\n\r\n## Biomech Hunter Drone\r\n\r\nMedium semi-sentient mechanoid (6d6)\r\nSTR 6 (3d6) AGI 10 (4d6) END 6 (3d6)INT 6 (3d6) LOG 1 (1d6) WIL 6 (3d6)CHA 6 (3d6) LUC 1 (1d6) REP 6 (3d6)\r\nMELEE DEFENCE 24RANGED DEFENCE 18MENTAL DEFENCE 12 (immune)VITAL DEFENCE 18\r\nHEALTH 36SOAK 6; VULN 1d6 electricity, 2d6 ionIMMUNE Sick, Fatigued\r\nINITIATIVE 6d6PERCEPTION 5d6; lifesenseSPEED 6; CLIMB 3; JUMP 20'/6'CARRY 120lb (max lift 300lb)\r\nREACH 5-ftACTIONS 2\r\n🅜 Bite 6d6 melee (3d6+3 piercing/electricity damage; nanites)\r\nSkills stealth 3 (2d6), perception 4 (2d6), reactions 6 (3d6). combat 6 (3d6)Gear -     \r\n\r\n## ──────────               \r\n\r\nNanites.

Minotaur pirates are feared, and Grand Elves traditionally have an enmity with the race, hunting down and bringing such pirates to justice.\r\n\r\nMinotaurs are arrogant, certain of their own superiority. However, they are also loyal—a minotaur will never break its word. Minotaurs are fond of tridents and nets, although many also choose to wield large and powerful axes. A Minotaur will traditionally wear a kilt and a breastplate of iron or bronze.

A Minotaur has horns which can be used in combat. The Minotaur’s unarmed (natural) damage increases by +1d6 and becomes piercing damage.\r\n- Bullrush. A Minotaur can lower their head and charge, horns-first, at a target of medium-size or larger. The Minotaur moves up to its full SPEED (minimum distance 10') in a straight line as a single action and makes a free unarmed attack at the end of it. The Minotaur must move in a straight line.\r\n- Direction Sense. A Minotaur always knows which direction is which, and how deep it is below ground or how far it is above ground. A Minotaur never becomes lost when traveling.\r\n- Sailors. Minotaurs are accomplished sailors. They gain one rank in each of the following skills: carousing, sailing, navigation.\r\n- Scent. Minotaurs have an incredible sense of smell, and gain +1d6 to INT (perception) checks where scent might be a factor.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/KCQeQLkcAgkchEYyj_mdkA86w8MEDfI7msZz5V47Vpl6Ptl0pMbxf5_4MxTvOVZCRd3KTNzZA3dFIPfJXtp537HK2VnoYFZ5PakCms0erDpPQ0wt=w1280)",

          "Markdown": "# Modern Armor Customizations\r\n\r\nAblative ($500). Highly effective, ablative armor absorbs damage by vaporizing when hit, successively destroying many overlapping sheets of protective material. Ablative armor starts with an additional 2 points of Soak. Its Soak value reduces by 1 point with each hit, and the actual weight of the armor lessens by 5 lbs.\r\n\r\nCamouflage ($300). Camouflage armor is an easy and cheap way to blend into the surroundings. Camouflage can be applied to any armor, and must be selected for a specific terrain (desert, snow, jungle, night, urban). Wearing the correct camouflage armor for the terrain grants a +1d6 bonus to checks to hide.\r\n\r\nReinforced ($700). Reinforced armor is built with heavy boots and a framework of metal that runs along the skeletal structure of the wearer and customized to fit their body. Only heavy armors can be reinforced, and they reduce the wearer’s movement by 1 but grant a +1d6 to opportunist stomp, throw, and trip combat exploits.\r\n\r\nResistant (varies). For every $1,000 spent (and each slot used), the armor gains +2 Soak against a specific damage type (but not ballistic damage, and not a damage type the armor is ineffective against). The type is chosen at the time of the upgrade. This stacks with the armor’s existing Soak.\r\n\r\nSpikes ($80). This medieval looking adjustment looks intimidating and exotic; however, their primary purpose is to cause damage to opponents who attempt to grab the wearer. Any attempt to grab the wearer of spiked armor causes the attacker 1d6 stabbing damage.\r\n\r\nThermal ($250). Thermal armor both protects against cold environments, and also grants 5 Soak vs. cold (cryo) damage.\r\n\r\nWeighted ($250). Weighted armors are entire outfits with small, precise lead weights sewn into the cuffs, arms, shoulders, hips, hems, and shoes. These impose a –1 penalty to the wearer’s physical ability scores when calculating derived attributes, but grant a +1 bonus to damage with melee attacks and if worn throughout a campaign, the cost for increasing their actual attribute is similarly reduced.",

          "Markdown": "# Modern Weapon Customizations\r\n\r\nHair trigger ($250). A second trigger allows the fire mechanism to be operated with very little pressure; a lighter trigger pull means that your aim is less likely to be disturbed. This upgrade grants you +1d6 Initiative as long as you use your firearm in the first round of combat. If you do not, you miss your turn.\r\n\r\nID-Matched ($500). An ID-Matched weapon can only be used by a single designated individual—usually its owner. The system uses a variety of biometric data to determine the user’s identity and will not function for any wielder other than that individual. This upgrade cannot be applied to simple weapons like clubs or swords; the weapon must have electronic or mechanical components which require activation.\r\n\r\nIlluminator ($50). This is essentially a mounted flashlight. It provides illumination in a 30' cone.\r\n\r\nIncreased damage ($1,000). You are using an unusual, possibly experimental, almost certainly illegal propellant. Your weapon does +1d6 damage.\r\n\r\nLaser sight ($500). A laser sight projects a small red dot onto the target. They are ineffective in bright light (including sunlight on a hot day), but when used grant a +1d6 attack bonus within the weapon’s first range increment.\r\n\r\nScope ($100). A scope is one of the most basic, common additions to a ranged weapon. It enables the wielder to more easily hit targets at greater range increments. A scope adds 50% to the range increment of a ranged weapon.\r\n\r\nAdvanced scope ($500). An advanced scope adds 100% to the weapon’s range increment instead of 50%.\r\n\r\nNight scope ($300). A night scope ($300) allows the user to operate a ranged weapon in complete darkness.\r\n\r\nSuppressor ($250). A suppressor (colloquially known as a “silencer”) is used to suppress the noise made from a gunshot. Only ballistic weapons can make use of a suppressor, making their use as quiet as a breath of wind but reducing their range by half. Shotguns and revolvers cannot use suppressor.\r\n\r\nStealthy ($500). A stealthy weapon is one composed of materials which do not register on security scanners (such as superhard plastic or hardened ceramics). The weapon will not, however, bypass a visual inspection.\r\n\r\nVented ($300). This upgrade is only available for heavy weapons. A vented heavy weapon has its STR requirement reduced by –1.",

It cannot regenerate a head which has been cauterized, however. A stump can be cauterized by making a called shot (-2d6) and doing at least 5 fire damage. The hydra's SOAK does not apply to cauterization attempts, but it does not lose any HEALTH: all damage simply goes to cauterize the stump.",

They can be very serious about their work, but are amongst the world’s greatest carousers.\r\n\r\nAn honorable race, Mountain Dwarves tend toward the serious-minded, although their reputation for sometimes excessive pride is not undeserved. Craftsmen, engineers, miners, metalworkers, stone workers—Mountain Dwarves are skilled with their hands, and most are equally skilled using weapons reminiscent of the tools of their trade. Hammers and axes, therefore, are common Dwarven weapons.\r\n\r\nMountain Dwarves, like most Dwarves, are stocky and broad. They stand about 4 feet tall; the males almost invariably sport beards, while the females do not. They are stronger and tougher than Humans, though they lack grace and agility. Mountain Dwarves are mortal; they live for about 250 years on average.\r\n\r\nA reputation for greed follows all Mountain Dwarves. Almost every member of the race is born with an innate appreciation of precious metals and rare gems, and much of their industry has historically been based around these things.\r\n\r\nMountain Dwarf adventurers are usually warriors. They tend to shun magic and have no innate natural ability.\r\n\r\n## Statistics\r\n\r\nSize/Type: Small; humanoid\r\n\r\nAttributes: END +2, WIL +2.\r\n\r\nSkill Choices: [crafting], alchemy, appraisal, axes, engineering, carousing, hammers, mining\r\n\r\n## Exploits\r\n\r\n- Darksight. Mountain Dwarves can see in the dark to a distance of 60', and when underground can see in the dark to any distance as though it were daylight.\r\n- Mountain Dwarf Longevity. When creating a Mountain Dwarf character, multiply your career lengths by 3.\r\n- Tough. Mountain Dwarves start play with an additional 2d6 HEALTH.\r\n- Iron Constitution. Mountain Dwarves are not affected by non-magical poisons, with the exception of alcohol.\r\n- Stubborn. Mountain Dwarves are noted for their stubborn demeanor. When taking a new career, a Mountain Dwarf may exchange one of the listed attribute increases for WIL, as long as this doesn’t result in duplicate attribute advancement.\r\n- Miners. When at least 30' underground, in an area with no view of the sky, Mountain Dwarves get +1d6 to all attribute checks except for attack rolls.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7RomaRbS_k2NPOvdEk0b1v932CeChbfKmeDdsl0YX6ZAukCNRWhRJ78M_TkxHM9_wpbVuqdcVwKToGae3zcIdMoIemJi_OSTEdwbANORRHke3TPZ=w1280)",

          "Markdown": "# Movement\n\nMovement is a vital part of any combat encounter. Any creature can use one action to move up to its SPEED. A creature’s SPEED indicates the number of 5-foot increments (squares) it can move in one action (it also indicates its normal speed in miles-per-hour).\n\nSPEED is the total of the raw dice pool of STRENGTH and AGILITY plus one relevant skill.  Movement skills include (but are not limited to) running, climbing, swimming, flying, and zero-g.\n\n- Movement methods. For non-primary movement methods, the movement rate is halved.  For most characters, this means that walking/running is at the full rate, and climbing, swimming, zero-g, etc. are at half rate (after adding the bonus from the skill).  Some exploits may grant a full movement rate.  Some creatures (such as birds) may have a different primary movement mode, and walk/run at half speed. A skill cannot turn a movement method into a primary method; only an exploit can do that.\n- Hustling. A character who moves with two actions in a turn is “hustling,” and effectively moving at twice its normal speed. Creatures with more than two actions available may not move more than twice in a turn. An Olympic sprinter typically has a SPEED of 10 or more, and is using both actions to run, resulting in movement in the range of 20 miles per hour.\n- Difficult terrain. Difficult terrain (deep snow, swamp, ice, high or low gravity, etc.) halves ground movement rates. Some exploits may allow full movement rates on one or more difficult terrain types.\n- Vehicles. A vehicle's SPEED is also its maximum speed in tens of miles per hour. A vehicle with a SPEED of 12 has a maximum speed of 120mph.\n- Diagonal movement. If a square grid is being used, a diagonal movement counts as 5’, but creatures may not move diagonally around a corner.\n- Climbing and balancing. Climbing is an AGI check. A successful check allows the climber to move at her climb speed up a vertical surface. The climber need only make one check per turn—this check applies to all climbing movement in that turn. Balancing on a narrow ledge or beam is a form of climbing. A failed check simply means that the character cannot climb the wall or object. She may attempt another check next turn. A high quality climbing kit can assist with climbing. The surface determines the difficulty of the climb.\n\n\n\n| Surface | Difficulty |\n| -------- | -------- |\n| Cliff, rough, many handholds \t\t| Challenging [13] |\n| Brick or stone wall, few handholds |\tDifficult [16] |\n| Ice or smooth metal | Demanding [21] |\n| Overhand or ceiling \t\t|\t\t\tDemanding [21] |\n| Narrow ledge or plank \t|\t\t\tChallenging [13] |\n| Tightrope \t\t\t\t\t| Strenuous [25] |\n\nFighting while climbing. Fighting while hanging from a wall is difficult. A non-climber attacking a climber gains a +2d6 bonus to the attack. A climber attacking a nonclimber suffers a –2d6 penalty. If both combatants are climbing, nobody gets any bonuses or penalties.\n\nCreatures with primary climbing modes. If a creature has climbing as a natural movement mode, it simply moves its Speed along walls and ceilings with no checks requires or combat checks imposed.\n\nFalling. Characters who fall from a height take 1d6 damage for every 10’ fallen. (Falls of less than 10’ do not cause damage.) Any fall results in the character landing prone unless an AGI check with a difficulty value equal to the number of feet fallen is made (this represents an attempt to reduce falling damage by jumping down; see below).\n\nJumping. Every character and creature has a “free” Jump allowance noted on its character sheet or stat block. This is a distance that the character may make a running jump without making any check at all; it simply happens automatically (for a standing jump, simply half the values). A jump counts as one action.",

          "Markdown": "# Movement Enhancements\r\n\r\nMove [creature], [element], or [self]\r\n\r\nMovement spells enhance movement abilities, allowing creatures to swim, burrow, fly, and travel at great speeds, or allow the caster to move inanimate objects, and sometimes creatures. For many movement spells, the duration of the spell will be an important cost.\r\n\r\nA move cantrip can grant +1 to one character’s Speed for up to one round.\r\n\r\n## Flight\r\n\r\nFly. Cost 8 MP. Fly gives the creature a Fly speed equal to its base Speed for the duration of the spell.\r\n\r\nAirwalk. Cost 5 MP. The creature can walk or stand on clouds as though they were solid ground.\r\n\r\nFeatherfall. Cost 1 MP. Featherfall makes the target fall at a maximum of 60'/round, which is slow enough that it will not take impact damage. Note that this does not reduce the creature’s weight; it simply falls slower.\r\n\r\nHover. Cost 2 MP. Hover allows the creature to travel in a straight horizontal line in mid-air, and downward at any angle, but not upward.\r\n\r\nLevitate. Cost 4 MP. Levitate allows a creature to move up or down 20' as a single action; only one action per round can be used for this movement.\r\n\r\nJump. Cost 1 MP per +5'. Increase your jump distance by 5' horizontally or vertically for each 1 MP spent.\r\n\r\n## Other Movement Moders\r\n\r\nMovement Modes (cost varies). These enhancements grant a creature new movement modes. The movement mode the spell grants becomes one of the creature’s natural movement mode for the duration (thus not requiring checks).\r\n\r\nBurrow. Cost varies. You can burrow through any material at half your Speed, as long as you pay the MP cost. The MP cost is equal to the Soak score of the material being burrowed through.\r\n\r\nSnowstep. Cost 1 MP. The creature can walk across snow or ice as though they were solid ground, suffering no movement or balance penalties.\r\n\r\nSwim. Cost 1 MP. The Swim effect gives the creature a Swim speed equal to its base Speed.\r\n\r\nWaterwalk. Cost 2 MP. The creature can walk across liquids as though they were solid ground.\r\n\r\nFree Movement. Cost 6 MP. Free movement allows creatures to move and attack normally, even under the effect of magical and mundane factors that usually  impede movement. This includes paralysis poison, or paralytic compulsion effects. The subject cannot be grappled, held, restrained, grabbed, or pinned. The spell also allows the subject to move and attack normally underwater, but not to breathe water.\r\n\r\nSpeed. Cost 1 MP per +1 Speed. Speed spells increases the speed at which a creature can move for the duration of the spell.\r\n\r\n## Anchoring\r\n\r\nSlow. Cost 1 MP per –1 Speed. Slowing spells actually slow creatures, reducing their base movement speeds for all forms of movement. Except when using the Immobilize or Anchor option, a creature’s base movement cannot be reduced below 1.\r\n\r\nAnchor. Cost 8 MP. If a creature or object is anchored, it cannot move, or be moved from its position at all, even by external forces. This does not paralyze the creature, however, so it can still take actions and defend itself normally. Anchor can be cast on the caster himself to make himself immovable.\r\n\r\nImmobilize. Cost 5 MP. The target gains the Restrained condition and is thus unable to move from its current spot. Additionally, the target cannot move from its spot using magical means of transport, like teleportation.. This does not paralyze the creature, however, so it can still take actions and defend itself normally.\r\n\r\n## Moving Objects\r\n\r\nTelekinesis. Cost varies. Telekinesis can be used to move objects or creatures at a Speed of 5. You could cause a wagon to roll forward on its wheels, make a taxidermied bird fly around, or make a chair skitter across the floor. You can also use it for simple manual tasks, such as untying knots or opening doors. You can only control the creature or object while it’s within range. If the creature or object moves beyond the spell’s range, the spell does not end, but you cannot control it until it enters range again. The size of the object you can move is given in the Common Enhancements table. Telekinesis requires concentration, and must have a duration of “concentration” selected.\r\n\r\nTelekinetic Thrust. Cost 2 MP per 5'. This is a focused application of telekinesis. You make a ranged attack using your MAG attribute against a target creature as normal, and shove it 5' for each 2 MP you spend. It is an instantaneous effect, and cannot have a duration attached. If you want to do damage, you need to add the appropriate evoke effect. This applies to creatures of size Large or smaller; the cost doubles for size Enormous (4 MP for 5'), double again for Gigantic (8 MP for 5'), and so on.\r\n\r\n## Quakes\r\n\r\nTremor. Cost 5 MP. The area shakes, and small objects fall off shelves. The entire area is considered difficult terrain for the duration of the spell.\r\n\r\nEarthquake. Cost 10 MP. The area shakes violently. Cracks appear, and some weak structures tumble. Creatures in the area are subject to an attack vs. Defense or they fall prone. The entire area is considered difficult terrain.",

They don’t often do well socially, facing hurdles connected to widespread prejudice for being visibly and genetically different.\r\n\r\n## Statistics\r\n\r\nSize: Medium; humanoid (some mutations can change your size)\r\n\r\nAttributes: CHI +1\r\n\r\nSkill Choices: hardy, intimidate, resistance, survival, [crafting], [trivia], [gaming], stealth, disguise.\r\n\r\n## Exploits\r\n\r\n- Mutation. Mutants have one or more mutations. Select one major or two minor mutations from the mutations list below. You have at least one cosmetic mutation that marks you as a mutant; decide what that is and add it to your character sheet.\r\n\r\n## Mutations\r\n\r\nCharacters with the Mutant heritage have powers beyond those of normal men and women. Whatever the source of the mutation—post-apocalyptic radiation, bites from mutant insects, a genetic evolution—mutants are still human, albeit … mutated.\r\n\r\nMutants may choose two minor or one major power from the following list. Each power has a ladder of increasing power; during character advancement, Mutants may pay the XP cost of a new exploit to upgrade a minor mutation, and the XP cost of a new grade to upgrade a major mutation. However, once created, mutants cannot normally obtain brand new mutations.\r\n\r\nOptionally, your GM may ask you to randomly roll d66 to choose your mutation(s). This can make for a fun, if unpredictable element to character creation. For that reason, the mutations below are listed as d66 entries.\r\n\r\n### Major Mutations\r\n\r\n11) Enhanced Strength. You are stronger than your build and size would suggest. When making a STR check (but not an attack) you may roll d8s instead of d6s. If you take this power a second time, the die type increases to d10s. If you take it a third time, it increases to d12s. Each time you take this mutation, your CARRY increment doubles.\r\n\r\n12) Enhanced Agility. You are supernaturally nimble. When making an AGI check (but not an attack) you may roll d8s instead of d6s. If you take this power a second time, the die type increases to d10s. If you take it a third time, it increases to d12s. Each time you take this mutation, your SPEED increases by 2.\r\n\r\n13) Enhanced Endurance. You are unusually tough, able to withstand more punishment than most. When making an END check you may roll d8s instead of d6s. If you take this power a second time, the die type increases to d10s. If you take it a third time, it increases to d12s. Each time you take this mutation, your HEALTH increases by +1d6.\r\n\r\n14) Enhanced Logic. You have incredible mental acuity and deductive powers. When making a LOG check you may roll d8s instead of d6s. If you take this power a second time, the die type increases to d10s. If you take it a third time, it increases to d12s.\r\n\r\n15) Enhanced Intuition. You are incredibly perceptive, with enhanced senses. When making an INT check you may roll d8s instead of d6s. If you take this power a second time, the die type increases to d10s. If you take it a third time, it increases to d12s.\r\n\r\n16) Enhanced Charisma. Your charisma is enhanced in some way. When making a CHA check you you may roll d8s instead of d6s. If you take this power a second time, the die type increases to d10s. If you take it a third time, it increases to d12s.\r\n\r\n21) Energy Emission. Choose one energy type (fire, cold, electricity, sonic). You can blast that energy from your hands, eyes, or even your mouth. You can make a ranged attack with a range increment equal to your END score, which does 2d6 damage of the appropriate type. You may take this power a second and third time, increasing the damage by +1d6 each time. Alternatively, you may use one of those upgrades to change the shape of your energy emission to a 15' cone.\r\n\r\n22) Danger Sense. You always know of impending danger, and cannot be flanked or subject to a crossfire. You gain 1d6 INITIATIVE. If you take this mutation a second and third time, your INITIATIVE bonus increases by +1d6 each time.\r\n\r\n23) Regeneration. You recover quickly from damage. Once per day you may spend one minute healing 2d6 HEALTH. If you take this mutation a second time, you may heal half your maximum HEALTH. If you take it a third time, you may heal up to your normal maximum HEALTH.\r\n\r\n23) Elemental Resistance. You gain SOAK 10 to one energy type (fire, cold, electricity, sonic). You may take this a second and third time, gaining an additional +5 SOAK to that energy type each time.\r\n\r\n24) Flight. Once per round you can fly your SPEED, but you must land at the end of the movement. If you take this mutation a second time, you may fly with both your actions, landing only at the end of the second (effectively doubling your flight distance). Taking it a third time allows you to fly any distance without landing. You may choose whether this gives you wings or some kind of self-telekinesis.\r\n\r\n25) Mutant Healing. With a mere touch you can heal another creature 2d6 HEALTH. If you take this mutation a second time, you may heal half their maximum HEALTH. If you take it a third time, you may heal up to their normal maximum HEALTH. Remember that no creature can benefit from the same source of healing more than once per day.\r\n\r\n26) Invisibility. Once per day you can turn invisible for up to one minute. If you take this mutation a second time, you can turn invisible for up to five minutes; if you take it a third time, you can turn invisible for up to one hour.\r\n\r\n31) Toughness. You gain natural SOAK 5. If you take this a second time, your natural SOAK increases to 10. If you take it a third time, it increases to 15.\r\n\r\n32) Drain Life. You can drain the very life from another creature. This may be a bite like that of the vampire, or it may be an icy touch which draws out their very essence— how you describe it is up to you. This melee attack requires two actions and causes 1d6 damage; you gain the amount of HEALTH you cause, up to your normal maximum HEALTH. If you take this a second time, the drain becomes 2d6, and a third time makes it 3d6. However, you cannot reduce any creature below half HEALTH using this power.\r\n\r\n33) Poison Bite. Your sharp teeth deliver poison. Your natural damage increases by +1d6 and becomes piercing/poison. If you take this a second time, your bite inflicts one of the following conditions (chosen when you first gain this ability): Poisoned, Sick, or Sleeping. If you take it a third time, your bite inflicts a disease of your choice.\r\n\r\n34) Shapechange. You are able to alter your form. You cannot make yourself look like a specific person, but you can make yourself generally taller, shorter, fatter, thinner, older, younger, or of a different ethnicity or gender. This changes none of your attributes or skills in any way. If you take this power a second time, you are also able to change your voice to match the form you have adopted. A third time allows you to take the form of specific people; however, you will need to make a CHA check against the INT of anybody who knows the person being mimicked.\r\n\r\n35) Spiderclimb. You can climb your normal SPEED. If you take this a second time, climbing becomes a natural movement mode for you, meaning that you do not need to make checks to climb. Taking it a third time makes you able to literally walk on walls and ceilings as though they were the floor.\r\n\r\n36) Internal Combustion Engine. Simply put, you are on fire. You have managed to convert your radiation into a boiling inferno. The inferno can be unleashed from your body for up to one minute per day by spending two actions, covering your skin in raging flames. You are immune to fire damage. While you are aflame, any creatures starting their turn adjacent to you take 1d6 fire damage. If you take this a second time, you may set yourself aflame three times per day. If you take it a third time, you may turn your flames on and off at will.\r\n\r\n41) Living Weapon. You can transform parts of your body, usually hands or feet, into sharp blades. This is often done by extruding the bone from underneath the skin, and thanks to the mutation the bone is as strong as steel, sometimes stronger. You can manifest any standard quality medium-sized or smaller one-handed bladed melee weapon by spending two actions.\r\n\r\n42) Rubberized Body. You have stretchy skin and bone. No one’s quite sure how you do it, but you can elongate parts of your body. You take half damage from falling, half damage from attacks which do blunt damage. If you take this a second time, your reach increases by +5', and your SPEED increases by +2. A third time makes you immune to falling and blunt damage.\r\n\r\n43) Ice Cold. You are freezing cold. You are immune to cold damage, and Vulnerable (1d6) to fire damage. Your touch does cold damage and inflicts the Restrained condition. If you take this a second time, your touch does +1d6 damage and freezes liquids within 5'. A third time increases the damage by another +1d6, and allows you to freeze solid objects (but not creatures) up to one 5' square in size and make them brittle so that any SOAK they have no longer applies.\r\n\r\n44) Acid Blood. Your blood is a strong acid. When you are hit by a slashing weapon, the attacker—if within 5'—takes 1d6 acid damage. If you take this a second time, the damage increases to 2d6 acid damage. A third time makes the acid strong enough to melt through half an inch of steel in one minute; this requires you to do 1d6 damage to yourself to extract enough blood, however.\r\n\r\n45) Tentacles. You look part human, part “something else.” Some part of you has been replaced by tentacles rather than hands, or feet. Perhaps your whole lower body has been replaced in this way and you have an unusual form of locomotion. Roll 1d6. On a roll of 1–3, your arms are replaced and you gain +5' reach; on 4–6, your legs are replaced and you become immune to difficult terrain. If you take this a second time, you gain the other benefit. A third time gives you one extra action each round (but you can still not take any given action more than twice).\r\n\r\n46) Projectile Spines. Rather like a porcupine, you have quills that you can eject at some force. Your quills have a range increment of 3, and do your natural damage. If you take this a second time, your quills gain +1d6 damage or do poison damage. Taking it a third time allows them to do both.\r\n\r\n51) Extra Appendage. You have more than the normal set of appendages—extra arms, legs, more than one nose, or four ears. Arms give you +1d6 STR, legs give you +1d6 AGI, and noses or ears give you +1d6 INT. However, you have a permanent –1d6 CHA.\r\n\r\n52) Animal Form. You can change into a medium-sized animal. Choose your alternate form; it takes two actions to change. When you change, you adopt the physical statistics of that animal, but your maximum dice pool does not change. Any damage you take in that form remains when you change back. If you take this a second time, you may change into a large or small animal; taking it a third time means you can change into any animal.\r\n\r\n53) Mimic. By touching another mutant, you can “borrow” their power for one minute (the target does not lose their own power—you are merely copying it). You may only borrow one power at a time. If you take this a second time you may borrow up to three powers at a time. A third time allow you to borrow as many powers as you wish. An unwilling target requires a melee attack roll in order to lay your hands on them for long enough to copy the power.\r\n\r\n54) Teleportation. You can spend two actions to teleport up to 30' as long as you can see your destination. Your clothing goes with you, as does gear you can carry up to your first CARRY increment, but you cannot take other living creatures with you. If you take this a second time, you can teleport as a single action; a third time allows you to teleport as a reaction to an attack.\r\n\r\n55) Probability Fields. You are able to literally influence luck. You can recharge your LUC pool an additional time per day. If you take this a second time, you are able to suppress the ability of another creature within 30' to use its LUC pool. A third time means that you can change the LUC pool of an ally you can see to d8s once per day for one check.\r\n\r\n56) Shockwave. You are able to emit a shockwave which attacks everybody within 10' of you. It does your natural damage, but the damage type is force damage. If you take this a second time, those successfully stuck are pushed back 5'. A third time increases the radius to 30' and knocks down medium or smaller creatures.\r\n\r\n61) Growth. You can increase your size to large or small for up to one minute. Taking it a second time allows you to change to enormous or tiny. A third time enables you to change size for up to one hour.\r\n\r\n62) Multiple Personalities. Create a second Mutant character. At the start of each day you must roll randomly to determine which character your are today. Taking this a second time allows you to create a third character. A third time allows you to choose which character you are each day, although you must remain that character until the next day.\r\n\r\n63) Immobile. You cannot be moved against your will for up to one minute per day. If you take this a second time, this lasts for up to one hour. A third time makes it permanent.\r\n\r\n64) Energy Absorption. You can absorb impressive amounts of harmful energy. You gain SOAK 5 to two types of energy or SOAK 10 to one type of energy, chosen from the following list: acid, cold, electricity, heat/ fire, or sonic. When you SOAK energy, you gain half that amount (round down) in HEALTH up to your maximum HEALTH. If you take this a second time, your SOAK values double. A third time allows you to gain the full amount absorbed as HEALTH.\r\n\r\n65) Power Nullifier. Within 30' of you mutant powers do not work. If you take this a second time, this also applies to psionic powers from N.E.W. A third time makes it apply to magic from O.L.D.\r\n\r\n66) Speedy. You gain an extra action each turn, although you cannot attack or move more than twice. If you take  this a second time, you may move or attack three times with your three actions, and if you take it a third time, your SPEED doubles.\r\n\r\n### Minor Mutations\r\n\r\n11) Darksight. You are able to see in the dark as though it were daylight. If you take this mutation a second time, you gain truesight, able to see through illusions and disguises, and to see the invisible. A third time allows you to see through solid objects and ignore concealment.\r\n\r\n12) Immune to Disease. You are completely immune to all non-magical diseases. If you take this mutation a second time, you are also immune to magical diseases. Taking it a third time makes you immune to radiation and poison.\r\n\r\n13) Self-Subsistent. You do not need to eat or drink. If you take this a second time, you also do not need to sleep. A third time means you do not need to breathe.\r\n\r\n14) Empathic Telepath. You can automatically send strong emotions within 30' of you. If you take this a second time, the range becomes as far as you can see. If you take it a third time, you are able to hear surface thoughts (although these are easily hidden by those aware enough to do so).\r\n\r\n15) Gills. You are able to breathe underwater. If you take this a second time, swimming becomes a natural movement mode for you, allowing your to swim your normal SPEED and to swim without making any attribute checks. If you take it a third time, you can talk to fish, although this does not imbue them with knowledge that they would not ordinarily have.\r\n\r\n16) Steel Teeth. Your unarmed damage becomes piercing damage. If you take this a second time, your teeth ignore 5 points of SOAK. A third time allows them to ignore 10 points of SOAK.\r\n\r\n21) Bone Spikes. You are covered in a layer of spikes which protrude through it from your bones. Your natural damage becomes piercing, and anybody who attempts to attack you unarmed takes 1d6 damage each time they strike. If you take this a second time, your natural damage increases by +1d6 and unarmed attackers take 2d6 damage when they strike. A third time means that armed melee attackers take 1d6 damage, while unarmed melee attackers take 2d6 damage.\r\n\r\n22) Chameleon. Your skin has an unusual pigmentation which enables your to change your skin like to that of a chameleon. You gain +1d6 to stealth checks. You can take this a second and third time, gaining an additional +1d6 each time.\r\n\r\n23) Displaced Organs. You might look human (or not), but your internal organs are in different places. You gain 2 natural SOAK, and you are immune to any exploits which rely on the attacker targeting your anatomy for extra damage. However, anybody attempting medical assistance on you suffers a –2d6 to their check. If you take this a second time, your SOAK increases to 4 and you are immune to critical hits. A third time increases your SOAK to 6 and allows you to ignore damage from an attack by spending one LUC die.\r\n\r\n24) Taller than Normal. Your height is greater than normal, even taller than the tallest member of the human race. Roll 1d6+6 to determine your height in feet. You are considered large-sized.\r\n\r\n25) Tiny. You are incredibly small, well below the human range of heights. You are size small, and stand about 1-foot in height. You gain +4 MELEE and RANGED DEFENSE, and -2 VITAL DEFENSE.\r\n\r\n26) Linguist. You are able to converse in any language.\r\n\r\n31) Atmosphere Processor. You can breathe in a variety of gaseous atmospheres, surviving in areas that would normally kill humans. You are immune to all gases. If you take this a second time, you can also breathe in any liquid. A third time means you do not need to breathe at all.\r\n\r\n32) Animal Affinity. You have an affinity with one animal type, such as cats, dogs, bears, or Tyrannosaurus rexes. If you take this a second time, you have affinity with one animal class, such as mammal, reptile, bird, fish, or dinosaur. A third time gives you affinity with all animals. While you do not gain the ability to talk to these animals, they will naturally regard you with friendship unless you give them a reason not to. They will not put themselves in danger for you, however.\r\n\r\n33) Longevity. You double the normal age categories. If you take this second time, you do not age, and remain in your current age category forever.\r\n\r\n34) Weather Control. You can influence the local weather within 30'. If you take this a second time, you can influence the weather within 100'. A third time lets you control it within one mile. The weather you create is not so intense that it can be used to directly attack another creature.\r\n\r\n35) Mutant Sense. You can detect the presence of mutants within 30'. Taking this a second time increases the range to line-of-sight. A third time enables you to determine their mutant powers (assuming they are not immediately visible).\r\n\r\n36) Levitation. You can hover above the ground at a height of up to 3 feet. This does not give you the ability to move horizontally, however. Taking it a second time allows you to hover up to 10' high, and a third time means you can hover up to 30' high.\r\n\r\n41) Claws. You have sharp claws. Your unarmed damage becomes slashing damage. Taking this a second time increases your unarmed damage by +1d6. A third time increases it by another +1d6.\r\n\r\n42) Leaper. You increase your JUMP distances by +10'. If you take this a second time, you instead double your JUMP distances or increase them by +10', whichever is greater. If you take it a third time, you may jump up to 30' horizontally and vertically.\r\n\r\n43) Scent. You have an unnaturally sensitive sense of smell. You get +1d6 to INT checks where scent might be a factor. If you take this a second time, the bonus goes up to +2d6, and a third time increases it to +3d6.\r\n\r\n44) Tail. You have a thick tail. As a free action you may make an unarmed attack against a foe behind you, within 5'. If you take this a second time, your tail gains a stinger which changes it to piercing/poison damage. A third time gives you a tail-sweep attack which attacks everybody in a 10' cone behind you; this attack does not use the stinger, but it knocks down anybody mediumsized or smaller that you successfully hit.\r\n\r\n45) Furry. You are covered in a coat of fur. You gain natural SOAK 5 (cold). If you take this a second time, you gain natural SOAK 5 (all) and SOAK 10 (cold). A third time gives you SOAK 10 (all) and immunity to cold.\r\n\r\n46) Horns. You have horns, or a horn. You gain +1d6 unarmed damage, which becomes piercing. If you take this a second time, you gain a gore attack which allows you to move your SPEED and impale a target on your horn, doing +1d6 damage. Taking it a third time allows you to inflict the Restrained condition on an impaled target, which takes your natural damage at the start of each of its turns until it gets free (which requires a melee attack against you).\r\n\r\n51) Sticky Tongue. You have a sticky tongue like a frog’s. You can use it to pick up small items within 10' as a free action. If you take this a second time, your tongue can reach 30'. A third time, and it is strong enough to hold medium-sized items.\r\n\r\n52) Super-Breath. You can make a melee attack against a target with a 10' range increment. If you hit, the target is pushed back 5'. Taking this a second time increases the push to 10', and a third time increases it to 30'.\r\n\r\n53) Ingester. You can consume any type of matter as food (although this does not give you the ability to damage materials you ordinarily could not). If you take this a second time, you become immune to poison.\r\n\r\n54) Telescopic Vision. You increase range increments by 50%. If you take it a second time, you double range increments. A third time means you no longer suffer range penalties up to three increments.\r\n\r\n55) Innate Skill. Choose a skill. You gain that skill at 10 ranks (4d6). You can take this power multiple times, gaining a new skill each time.\r\n\r\n56) Glowing. You are able to glow with bright light, illumination the area within 30' of you. You cannot hide while glowing. If you take this a second time, your glow is so bright that you gain +2 to both MELEE and RANGED DEFENSE. A third time causes anybody who enters or starts their turn in the aura to gain the Blind condition.\r\n\r\n61) Plant Control. In natural surroundings you can immobilise a target within 30' with a melee attack; vines and creepers wrap around the victim, rendering him immobilized. The target can shake this off as normal. If you take this a second time, the plants will crush and strangle the victim, causing 2d6 unSOAKable damage at the start of each of his turns. A third time allows you to attack all targets within 30'.\r\n\r\n62) Hypnotic Gaze. With a CHA mental attack you can inflict the Charmed condition on an adjacent target once per round. If you take this a second time, you may affect a target who can see you within 30'. A third time extends the power to your voice, so that the target merely needs to be able to hear you.\r\n\r\n63) Ventriloquism. You can make your voice appear to emanate from anywhere within 30'. If you take this a second time, you may mimic other voices. A third time allows you to mimic any sound.\r\n\r\n64) Fearless. You are completely immune to fear and fear-based conditions, and cannot be intimidated.\r\n\r\n65) Bouncy. You ignore falling damage from 20' or less. If you take this a second time, you take half damage from all falling damage. A third time makes you completely immune to falling damage.\r\n\r\n66) Double-Jointed. Your joints all bend in both directions. You can spend a LUC die to automatically escape from any restraints. If you take this a second time, you can contort yourself to fit through gaps as small as onefoot in diameter. A third time means that you cannot be immobilized or restrained unless you allow it (although you can be confined in a cell or similar).\r\n\r\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Uy8oqfWjEE8pAzJluXBGidacLhfCnQxe3sygHZMctpI5x0T-mNGZUBtOgPZtkupz2y6K_FwO2h7zKwneZOwue-6x7GtsJZOSnWiZsKVQt52joP6O=w1280)",

Others, like the ones dealt with here, are much denser and can actually obscure vision.\r\n\r\nThe main issue with nebulae is the way they interfere with sensors. Starship sensors can suffer penalties from -1d6 to -3d6, or be rendered inoperable, depending on the density of the nebula, and FTL travel speeds are reduced to half normal.

The victim suffers -1d6 on all checks due to constant chortling and giggling. Additionally, the first time the victim takes damage in each encounter, he falls prone in a sudden fit of inexplicable laughter at the pain.               \r\nPrey for the Coven. All attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to the affected creature. Natural animals are spooked by the affected creature.",

If you want to break a door down, your GM may ask you for a STR check.\n\n## AGILITY (AGI) \n\nDexterity and reflexes. It is also used to determine ranged attacks and some melee attacks. You might use your AGI to perform a fancy shuttle maneuver or to land safely after a nasty fall.\n\n## ENDURANCE (END) \n\nHealthiness, constitution, and hardiness. It is used to determine your overall HEALTH score. An END check might also be used to resist the effects of poison or disease.\n\n## INTUITION (INT)\n\nCommon sense, perception, empathy, and natural instinct. It is used to tell when someone is lying, spot something, or sense impending danger. Some might refer to it as “EQ” or “emotional intelligence”. Animals often have high INT attributes, especially those with keen senses.\n\n## LOGIC (LOG)\n\nReasoning, knowledge, and education. While IQ isn't a great measure of intelligence, 60 + (LOG x 10) gives an approximate IQ in the mid-ranges. You would make a LOG check to operate a complex electronic device, apply first-aid, or recall specific knowledge\n\n## WILLPOWER (WIL) \n\nStrength of mind and power of concentration. Along with END, it determines your overall HEALTH.\n\n## CHARISMA (CHA) \n\nPhysical attractiveness, personal magnetism, and force of personality. It is the attribute used when interacting with others, whether leading them, negotiating with them, or deceiving them. While physical appearance is part of the CHA score, it is a minor part at best (especially in a universe full of aliens with differing standards of beauty); far more important are personality and presence.\n\n## LUCK (LUC)\n\nAn unpredictable force. Some people are naturally luckier than others. LUCK has some properties that other attributes do not have.\n\n## REPUTATION (REP) \n\nFame, respect, influence, and contacts. Your REPUTATION attribute determines if people recognize or have heard of you, and determines your starting money. REP has elements of fame, rank, respect, social standing, and - in some settings - even credit ratings. REP can also be used for many of the things that a CHA check can.",

          "Markdown": "# Psionics\r\n\r\nLike all exploits, psionic exploits are available to anybody who qualifies for them.\r\n\r\nSome psionic careers offer a number of psionic exploits in the form of career exploits. In some cases, these same exploits are also available below as universal exploits; in other cases they are unique to that career or superior to the universal version. This allows GMs to exclude psionics as a whole if they wish, while retaining the powers associated with specific careers – especially where the psionic powers in a setting are strongly flavoured and narrowly focused. It also enables certain careers to gain certain psionic abilities without having to meet the same prerequisites that those accessing them via universal exploits do.\r\n\r\nPsionic flavor comes in many forms. Whether it's a mental discipline, a wild talent, a galaxy-spanning force, or powers granted by microscopic symbiotic organisms, the GM will need to make certain overall decisions regarding the presence of psionics in the game.\r\n\r\nChecks and attacks. Most psionic powers operate automatically, with no attribute check being required. However, if a psionic power affects an unwilling target or creature, a PSI vs. DEFENSE or MENTAL DEFENSE attack is always required.\r\n\r\nSkills. Exploits are divided into categories (biopsionics, clairsentience, clairvoyance, ergokinesis, metapsionics, telekinesis, telepathy, and teleportation), each of which is a psionic skill which can be learned and applied to dice pools as normal.\r\n\r\nCost. The cost in psionic energy points (PP) to use a power is equal to the PSI score prerequisite. Thus, if a power has a prerequisite of PSI 6, it also costs 6 PP to use.\r\n\r\nBoosting. Psionic exploits are often more powerful the more psionic energy points (PP) you use. Many powers indicate that numerical elements such as range or damage are dependent on the amount of power used. You cannot spend more psionic energy points per turn than the value of your PSI attribute. A character with a PSI attribute of 10 cannot spend more than 10 PP per turn.\r\n\r\nMaintenance. Powers which last until your next turn can be maintained continuously by spending an action each round. If the power required an attack roll, then this must be made each round unless otherwise stated. The power cost must be paid every round.\r\n\r\nPower. Roll your PSI dice pool and your WIL dice pool and add the two together. You have a pool of psionic energy points (PP) equal to this roll. If your PSI or WIL dice pools increase, roll the extra die and add it to your pool. Once a day you may meditate to recover PP equal to a WIL check.\r\n\r\nPsionic equipment. The equipment section of this book contains a range of psionic (and anti-psionic) gear.\r\n\r\nThe following exploits are universal exploits and require a single action to use unless otherwise noted.\r\n\r\n## Biopsionics\r\n\r\nAdrenalize (requires PSI 4). You can channel positive energy into somebody, granting them a +1d6 die bonus per 4 PSI to all physical attribute checks for one minute. This process is draining, however, and causes you 1d6 psionic damage for each 1d6 bonus you grant.\r\n\r\nBiofeedback (requires PSI 4). You psychically harden your skin, gaining SOAK natural 1 +1 per PSI until your next turn.\r\n\r\nPsychic healing (requires PSI 6). You can heal 1d6 per 6 PSI HEALTH by touch. Any given creature can only benefit from this power once per day.\r\n\r\nPsychic resuscitation (requires PSI 6). You may stabilize a dying creature by touch by spending two actions.\r\n\r\n## Clairsentience\r\n\r\nHypercognition (requires PSI 8). When you use this power, everything appears to slow down for you. For 1 round per 4 PSI, you gain an extra action each round. Using this power is a free action.\r\n\r\nPrecognition (requires PSI 4). Your natural precognition gives you a +1d6 per 4 PSI bonus to INITIATIVE checks as well as checks to access the ambush turn.\r\n\r\nRetrocognition (requires PSI 12). You can see into the past up to 1 day per PSI until your next turn. Your view is of your current location as though you were there at the time.\r\n\r\n## Clairvoyance\r\n\r\nClairvoyance (requires INT 6, PSI 6). You can see and hear a location you have seen before until your next turn. You see it as though you were physically present, and do not gain additional sight powers (so if it is dark there, you do not gain darksight).\r\n\r\n## Ergokinesis\r\n\r\nCryrokinetic blast (requires END 6, PSI 6). You blast an opponent with a range increment of 10' with an icy cold wind. Make a PSI vs. DEFENSE attack; if you succeed, you do 1d6 per 2 PSI cold damage.\r\n\r\nElectrokinetic blast (requires INT 6, PSI 6). You blast an opponent with a range increment of 10' with a bolt of focused electricity. Make a PSI vs. DEFENSE attack; if you succeed, you do 1d6 per 2 PSI electricity damage.\r\n\r\nElectrokinetic fork (requires PSI 10). You let loose a 5' per 2 PSI cone of crackling, forked electricity. Make a PSI vs. DEFENSE attack against each creature in the area; if you succeed, you do 1d6 per 5 PSI electricity damage.\r\n\r\nPyrokinestic burst (requires END 8, PSI 12). You let loose a burst of fire in all directions. Any creature or object within 5' per 4 PSI of you takes 1d6 heat damage per 6 PSI.\r\n\r\nPyrokinetic blast (requires AGI 6, PSI 6). You blast an opponent with a range increment of 10' with a cascade of fire. Make a PSI vs. DEFENSE attack; if you succeed, you do 1d6 per 2 PSI fire damage.\r\n\r\n## Metapsionics\r\n\r\nCannibilize (requires END 6). You are able to recover psionic energy by drawing from your body's other energy reserves. Choose any number of d6s and roll them; you gain that much psionic energy, but take the same amount of damage.\r\n\r\nFast recovery. You recover twice as much psionic energy during your daily meditation.\r\n\r\nMind shield (requires WIL 6, PSI 6). You shield your mind from psionic intrusion, gaining +4 MENTAL DEFENSE +1 per 5 PSI until your next turn.\r\n\r\nSense psionics (requires PSI 2). You can sense the presence of psionics within 20' +5' per 2 PSI of you.\r\n\r\nShield other (requires WIL 8, PSI 8; Mind Shield). You shield another's mind within 10' of you, granting them +8 MENTAL DEFENSE +1 per 4 PSI until your next turn.\r\n\r\nSuppression. You are able to weaken the psionic power of a target you can see. Choose any number of PSI points; both yours and your target's PSI attribute are reduced by that amount until your next turn if you make a successful PSI vs. MENTAL DEFENSE attack.\r\n\r\nMind fortress (requires WIL 8, PSI 10; Shield Other). As Shield Other, but it affects everyone you choose within 2' per PSI of you. They must remain within that distance to stay protected.\r\n\r\n## Telekinesis\r\n\r\nFlight (requires PSI 10, AGI 8; Levitation). As Levitation, but you can also move horizontally.\r\n\r\nPsychokinesis (requires PSI 9; Telekinesis). Your telekinetic control is so refined that you can effectively take any action or make any attribute check that you would normally be able to do were you standing next to the target from a distance of 5' per PSI.\r\n\r\nLevitation (requires PSI 8; Telekinesis). You telekinetically lift yourself off the ground until your next turn. You can only move directly up and down, and may do so at a speed of 5' per 2 PSI. If the power fails, or you do not maintain it, you fall from whatever height you are currently at.\r\n\r\nSummon (requires PSI 4). You can telekinetically call a Small or smaller object within 5' per 2 PSI to your hand by using two actions. If the object is held by someone else, it will require an opposed PSI vs. STR check.\r\n\r\nTelekinesis (requires PSI 5; Summon). You can freely telekinetically move and manipulate single objects of size Small or smaller within 5' per 1 PSI of you. You may only manipulate one such object at a time.\r\n\r\nTelekinetic shield (requires PSI 4). You gain +3 DEFENSE +1 per 4 PSI from a telekinetic shield until your next turn.\r\n\r\n## Telepathy\r\n\r\nEmpathy (requires PSI 2). You can automatically sense strong emotions in others within 30'.\r\n\r\nMind control (requires PSI 16; Psychic Suggestion). You control another being within 5' per PSI until your next turn by making a PSI vs. MENTAL DEFENSE attack. The creature will act as you direct; however it will not perform an action which causes it harm. If you spend an action to maintain this control over multiple turns, it lasts 1 round per PSI.\r\n\r\nMindprobe (requires PSI 12; Mindread). As Mindread, but you gain access to inner thoughts and secrets. This technique is painful to the target, who takes 1d6 psychic damage.\r\n\r\nMindread (requires PSI 10; Empathy). This invasive technique enables you to read another's mind. Make a PSI vs. MENTAL DEFENSE attack against a target within 1' per PSI. If you succeed, you are able to read uppermost thoughts until your next turn.\r\n\r\nMindwipe (requires PSI 14; Psychic Suggestion). You are able to erase your target's memory as far back as 1 hour per PSI. Make a PSI vs. MENTAL DEFENSE attack.\r\n\r\nPerception filter (requires PSI 5). You render yourself hard to notice with a telepathic effect which causes others to simply ignore you. Perception filters work automatically on those with an INT attribute of less than your PSI score, while more intuitive creatures will notice you immediately. If you make an attack, the effect ends immediately. Creatures aware of you cannot thereafter be affected by the perception filter.\r\n\r\nPsi-blast (requires PSI 4). You can use an action and make a PSI vs. MENTAL DEFENSE attack to blast an opponent with a mental burst which does 1d6 +1d6 per 4 PSI psionic damage and has a range increment of 10'.\r\n\r\nPsychic cone (requires PSI 8; Psi-Blast). You project a 4' per PSI cone of psychic energy which causes 1d6 +1d6 per 4 PSI psychic damage to all in the area of effect.\r\n\r\nPsychic suggestion (requires PSI 8; Telepathic Message). You can momentarily influence the thoughts and actions of another creature within 5' per PSI by making a PSI vs. MENTAL DEFENSE check. On a success, the creature will perform one action as directed by you; however it will not perform an action which causes it harm.\r\n\r\nTelepathic message (requires PSI 4; Empathy). You develop the ability to freely send short telepathic messages to other intelligent creatures with whom you have spent time.\r\n\r\n## Teleportation\r\n\r\nBlink (requires AGI 8; Dimensional step). As a reaction to an attack, you may instantly teleport up to 10' to avoid it. This grants you a +10 DEFENSE bonus and moves you to any location within 10'.\r\n\r\nDimensional step (requires PSI 10). You teleport up to 10' per 4 PSI to a location within sight.\r\n\r\nTeleport (requires PSI 16; Dimensional Step). You teleport any distance up to 1AU to a location you have physically seen. This does not include locations seen by remote viewing devices.",

Some may have been ejected from their system, doomed to wander the void eternally alone, while others may have formed independently. The closest rogue planet to Earth is PiSO (PSO J318.5-22) which is 80 light years away and has an immense network of geothermally heated caves.\r\n\r\nRogue planets drift in cold interstellar space; while most have no atmosphere (or a frozen atmosphere) some – for reasons of pressure or other factors – can maintain one. Indeed, some rogue planets are able to sustain liquid water due to geothermal heat, while those with satellites also benefit from tidal heating. Civilizations can evolve never having seen a local star or sun.\r\n\r\nRogue planets can also exist in between galaxies. For these planets, the night sky is devoid of much other than the occasional distant galaxy. Civilizations on such planets may not even be aware of the existence of stars.",

An unconscious character uses the countdown mechanic as he slips towards death.\r\n- Illness. Disease and illness use the countdown mechanic as symptoms worsen.\r\n- Drowning or suffocation. Characters who cannot breath (underwater, or some other reason) use the countdown mechanic to determine when they lose consciousness.\r\n- Starship explosions. In N.E.W., badly damaged starships use a countdown pool to determine when they explode; hopefully the heroes can escape the ship before it does!\r\n- Other ticking clocks.There are many other situations where a ticking clock is relevant. Occasions where you need a tense situation as a character tries to do something before something else happens are ideal for it. Can a climber scale a crumbling cliff before it collapses? Can a thief pick a lock before the magical alarms go off? Can a Smallfolk burglar recover the magic goblet and escape the dragon's lair before it wakes up?\r\n\r\nThe countdown is started by forming a dice pool. Different situations will determine the size of that dice pool – a dying character uses one equal in size to his ENDURANCE dice pool, for example, while cliffs or magical alarms will have their dice pool size set by the GM. The larger the dice pool, the longer you – probably! - have.\r\n\r\nEach turn, the dice pool is rolled. Usually it's rolled by the player in question – she rolls her own death dice, or her own drowning dice.\r\n\r\nAny dice which comes up with a six is removed from the dice pool, and play continues.\r\n\r\nEventually the last dice will be removed from the dice pool. It is then that the character dies, the trap explodes, or the soldier looks in the crate.\r\n\r\n## Fast, Medium, And Slow Countdowns\r\n\r\nThe default countdown—removing a dice on a roll of 6—is a slow countdown. Countdowns can run down faster than this, however. For faster countdowns, dice are removed on rolls of 5–6, or even 4–6.\r\n\r\nA countdown is always expressed in terms of a fast, medium, or slow countdown. The default countdown (if not specified) is a slow countdown expiring on rolls of 6.\r\n\r\n- Fast (4-6)\r\n- Medium (5-6)\r\n- Slow (6)\r\n\r\n## Stabilizing and Replenishing Countdowns\r\n\r\nSome countdowns can be stabilized or replenished. A stabilized countdown simply stops counting down— the trap has been disarmed in time, or the character is no longer in danger of dying.\r\n\r\nReplenishing a countdown allows extra dice to be added, effectively extending it. In this way, illnesses can be pushed back “up” the countdown and dying characters can be stabilized with emergency healing.\r\n\r\nNot all countdowns can be stabilized or replenished; the specific countdown will clearly indicate whether or not these are appropriate. Sometimes the cliff is going to crumble whatever you do—it’s just a question of whether you get to the top before that happens!\r\n\r\n## Countdowns and Stages\r\n\r\nMost countdowns are fairly simple—the dice pool is rolled until it reaches zero, at which point an effect (death, explosion, and so on) takes place. However, some countdowns have effects which take place at various stages throughout the process. Stages take place as the dice pool reaches certain sizes. For example, an illness might have a character becoming blind when the pool reaches two dice, and dying when it reaches zero dice. All countdowns technically have two stages—the starting condition and the ending condition.\r\n\r\n## Average Countdown Length\r\n\r\nThe table below shows the expected (average) number of rolls a countdown will last for before expiry. This can be used by the GM to set appropriate countdown dice pools. Note, however, that countdown pools can be very 'swingy' and a large pool might still deplete quickly while a small one might take longer.\r\n\r\nDice Pool \t\tSlow \tMedium\tFast \r\n\t\t\t\t(6)\t\t(5–6) \t\t(4–6)\r\n\r\n1d6 \t\t\t6 \t\t3 \t\t\t2\r\n\r\n2d6 \t\t\t9 \t\t4 \t\t\t3\r\n\r\n3d6 \t\t\t11 \t\t5 \t\t\t3\r\n\r\n4d6 \t\t\t12 \t\t6 \t\t\t4\r\n\r\n5d6 \t\t\t13 \t\t6 \t\t\t4\r\n\r\n6d6 \t\t\t14 \t\t7 \t\t\t4\r\n\r\n7d6 \t\t\t15 \t\t7 \t\t\t4\r\n\r\n8d6 \t\t\t15 \t\t7 \t\t\t4\r\n\r\n9d6 \t\t\t16 \t\t7 \t\t\t5\r\n\r\n10d6 \t\t\t17 \t\t8 \t\t\t5",

          "Markdown": "# Creating Monsters\r\n\r\nThis creature design engine is a process by which you will be able to easily create a monster, creature, or generic NPC type. You can create anything from alien monstrosities to reusable NPC stat blocks such as “Soldier” or “Psionic Interrogator”\r\n\r\nMonsters and generic NPCs tend to be a bit more arbitrary than player characters. Of course, a monster can have whatever statistics you need - if you need your 3-foot alien furry bear to have STR 20 or 200 HEALTH for some reason, you can just assign those values. The following is just a set of guidelines to help your design process; feel free to ignore any of them.\r\n\r\nThis method is the reverse method to creating a character, because you are starting at your desired result and working backwards - you will know in advance that you want an 8d6 “brute” style robot, and this informs the rest of the creature’s statistics.\r\n\r\nOnce you have decided on your creature concept, following these steps.\r\n\r\nImportant! It is important to treat this process as a guide only. It is a tool to help you design creatures, but it is advisory only, not proscriptive. You can and should deviate from the figures below when it is thematically appropriate to do so.\r\n\r\n[Try the Monster Builder](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.enworld.org%2Ftools%2Fmonster.php&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw0BgqkLfGplsTvCqXKgfYoW)\r\n\r\n## 1. Max Dice Pool (MDP)\r\n\r\nChoose your monster’s Maximum Dice Pool. This will decide many of the following statistics. You should start with an idea of how powerful you want your monster to be. For comparison, a starting character is 5d6, and a fire dragon is 15d6.\r\n\r\nPCs tend to be a little more optimised than monsters, so monster scores are slightly higher. Generally, a monster with +1 MDP over a PC is a challenging match which the PC should win. +2 MDP means the PC will probably lose one-on-one, and with +3 MDP the PC is almost certain to be defeated.\r\n\r\nThroughout this section, the term “MDP” means “Maximum Dice Pool”. Throughout this section, when you halve, quarter, or otherwise divide the MDP to derive a value, always round up.\r\n\r\n## 2. Role, Size, & Type\r\n\r\nChoose a “role”, a size category, and a type for your monster.\r\n\r\nThe role is just a broad descriptive tag which is not used in-game, but can be useful when designing. Choose from:\r\n\r\n- - Artillery. A creature which does area damage from a distance, such as a grenadier or a ranged heavy robot.\r\n    - Brute. A creature focuses on raw melee power, smashing its foes to the ground, such as a great ferocious beast or a mighty robot.\r\n    - Expert. A creature whose focus is not combat, such as a medic, engineer, or pilot.\r\n    - Ninja. A fast, mobile melee creature, able to attack quickly and accurately and dance around its opponents.\r\n    - Skirmisher. A fast, mobile, ranged creature, weak in melee, but able to keep its distance and pick off its targets from afar. Many gun-toting bandits are skirmishers.\r\n    - Support. A creature which heals or buffs other creatures, or alters the battlefield; this could be a specialist support robot, or an adept commander.\r\n    - Trickster. A frustrating opponent such as a teleporter, or psychic foe, able to inflict a range of conditions.\r\n\r\nThese names don’t really mean anything. They are descriptive tools during the design process, but you’ll never need them again once the creature is finished.\r\n\r\nThe creature’s size uses the same scale as player characters, and includes tiny (mouse-sized), small (dog-sized), medium (human-sized), large (tiger-sized), enormous (elephant-sized), gigantic (whale-sized), colossal (kaiju-sized), and titanic .\r\n\r\nYou also need to know the creature’s type. This is an open-ended list which includes, but is not limited to, the following creature types: aquatic, avian, beast, changeling, crystalline, insectoid, humanoid, gaseous, mechanoid, plant, projection, and reptile. A creature can have more than one type, of course - it might be an avian mechanoid or a crystalline plant. The type will help determine some of the creature’s exploits, which you’ll list at the end of this process.\r\n\r\nIts important to note that this is just an “introductory” list of creature types; you can no doubt imagine more exotic things like oozes and electricity monsters, and many more.\r\n\r\nUsing these details, note the monster’s descriptor, which is formed as follows:\r\n\r\n[size] [sentience] [types] (dice pool)\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nLarge semi-sentient mechanoid beast (7d6)\r\n\r\n## 3. Attributes\r\n\r\nA creature’s attributes depends on the monster’s role, which you chose in the previous step. Only give the creature a MAG/PSI/CHI score if you want it to have a supernatural ability. A creature’s REP score will help determine how much the player characters (and others) know about it. The creature’s mental statistics assume that the creature is sentient, but non-sentient, semi-sentient, and super-sentient creatures may radically alter these values in the next step.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Mna-1BI3pC3p76nlHvgQE88heA1xQYezjq9RafokSt8ZKAKq8E2fCq1_jvwGdH0KOK00rYrN8kbvrUWG6x-t1dY77i3YfF1HUam7Qgw_abCZtVNN=w1280)\r\n\r\n## 4. Sentience\r\n\r\nAlso consider the creature’s sentience.  Sentience typically comes in the following categories, and can alter the creature’s mental statistics in the following ways.\r\n\r\nNote that if you are giving a semi-sentient creature a 'career' (see below), it should be elevated to a sentient creature.\r\n\r\nNon-sentient.Non-sentient does not necessarily mean non-intelligent. Non-sentient creatures are immune to mental attacks.\r\n\r\nSemi-sentient. These are dogs, wolves, bears, and other animal-level intelligent creatures.  Semi-sentient creatures have 1-2 (1d6) LOG (carnivores are usually more intelligent than herbivores), and may often have INT attributes as high as their AGI attributes. INT represents senses, perception, and animal cunning.  Note that creatures known for specific senses (such as owls) can also have extremely high skill ranks in those specific abilities. CHA tends to be 1 (for ugly critters) or 2 (for attractive critters). WIL will tend to be around average (4) unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise.\r\n\r\nSentient.This includes most living sentient creatures with LOG attributes of 2 or more. Sentient creatures should be assigned mental attributes normally.\r\n\r\nSuper-sentient.Generally with LOG and INT attributes of 20 or more, these creatures are supra-geniuses far beyond even the greatest of humans. Super-sentient creatures automatically have the power of truesight, which enables them to see through illusions, invisibility, and disguises. They can also see in the dark, and through obscuring effects like smoke, although not through cover. Additionally, super-sentient creatures can automatically speak and understand any language.\r\n\r\n## 5. DEFENSES\r\n\r\nYou now need to determine the creature’s four DEFENSEs. Each DEFENSE is high, medium, or low, and is based on the monster’s MDP. The lowest a DEFENSE can be is 10.\r\n\r\nIf your monster doesn’t fit neatly into these categories, that’s fine (a dragon is a brute with some artillery traits, for example). Just pick the closest match and tweak it, or use entries from different roles. Remember, these are guidelines, not rules.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/1gDniaDj9u8nFGnAxXYv3FbbRMY_Ik7sQFVXkuVkC-zOSCt-thoZzD6cl2AaNnwkZYz-7woUpZLhzH1Fb84fvtrYDnWyaljFmIwY-VF3GELfl9oW=w1280)\r\n\r\n## 6. Size\r\n\r\nYou then need to adjust for SIZE (see the table below). While size can affect physical attributes, it does not necessarily correlate to them - a tiny, tiny tardigrade might have an END score many times higher than a human. STR, however, is an attribute you might consider capping by size; you don’t have to (after all, there’s nothing wrong with a tiny super-strong robot!) but a suggested cap is presented in the table below.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/5DapYYx8LJU2uNrBskRYuMjmN9M4Qllc9DhXj4nIHZXHeB5zzodFD5ruOnRnxwVmV1aD4WItFbC-8MZs2FHpxkBgDVU0Ije3m2J1RGZ6EtVSfpZI=w1280)\r\n\r\n## 7. SOAK\r\n\r\nMost creatures have a SOAK value. When you assign SOAK, you won’t necessarily know where that SOAK comes from - it may be from armor they are wearing, or from a tough hide, or thick fur, or a hard shell. You’ll have a total amount of SOAK appropriate to the creature; you can describe it however you wish.\r\n\r\nLike before, you will be choosing from high, medium, and low SOAK. However, you should be very cautious about allowing SOAK scores above 20 -- the hardest substances in the core rules are diamond and duranium at SOAK 20 and tritanium and adamantium at SOAK 25. Unless you have a very compelling reason to do otherwise, you should cap the SOAK at 20.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gyt9S1cI5GdMZo8p-o4Ud2gFkdKT57uPabgHI1UATDr9CZlGQyndp_Iwn2rJLL0lXjfieMUF_ubOdtEUXJbeB0bjeuNKK2MZTZpeODT0MevmPiZ7=w1280)\r\n\r\n## 8. HEALTH\r\n\r\nHEALTH is an important value. As always, we choose from high, medium, and low, scores, and then we adjust for size. These values can be found in the same table as the SOAK table.\r\n\r\nSize affects HEALTH as follows: enormous x1.5, gigantic x2, colossal x3, and titanic x5.\r\n\r\nMonsters tend to have higher HEALTH than PCs. This abstracts the fact that they don’t have all the resources available that PCs have to heal and recover.\r\n\r\n## 9. INITIATIVE, PERCEPTION, & SPEED\r\n\r\nUsing the same method, determine your monster’s INITIATIVE, PERCEPTION, and SPEED scores.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/oorCkw2XwSBlqCqI8eXtCae1yWICqznB53v0clwGkNl18LCw_T54-fbcxi7OwTMAvNf0M7RdwDRGNFu2l6v2nb7BYySSaGeZ5B6ArQI08R2CjNdl=w1280)\r\n\r\nYou will need to assign movement modes at this time. The listed SPEED is for the creature’s primary movement mode. For additional modes, it moves at half SPEED.\r\n\r\nIf a creature has a natural movement mode, it is denoted in the stat block with a “+” symbol (e.g. CLIMB+ 8); this means that it does not need to make any attribute checks to move in this manner, and it uses the speed listed for the primary movement mode.\r\n\r\nIf the creature can fly, you should note whether or not it can hover by putting the word “hover” in parenthesis after its FLY speed; if it cannot hover, it must move at least half its FLY speed each round to stay aloft.\r\n\r\n## 10. Attacks\r\n\r\nYou will need to determine the creature’s melee and ranged attack pools, plus an optional mental attack pool and psionic attack pool. Only include the latter two if they are relevant; the psionic attack pool, if it exists, is the same as the most thematically similar existing attack pool - most likely ranged (for something like a lightning bolt) or mental (for something like a psionic blast).\r\n\r\nMost creatures will only use their primary attack pool, but if a PC charges a ranged attacker, it might be forced to resort to its weaker attack mode.\r\n\r\nThe attack values in particular can be tweaked. If you want your brute to have a high ranged attack, go right ahead and assign it.\r\n\r\nYou might consider giving some creatures with a high single attack a secondary medium area attack. A dragon’s breath weapon would be a good example of this.\r\n\r\nDamage.Damage tracks with the attack pool, and is 50% of the attack pool. For example, an attack pool of 8d6 means 4d6 damage, while 7d6 would become 3d6+3. You will need to assign the damage type manually.\r\n\r\nRange.A ranged attack has a range in 5’ squares of MDP x 1.5, unless the creature is a skirmisher or artillery, in which case the range is MDP x 2.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AZQsJfp789ET04ZGhPqTkYHo8zKWuUNuVn7qQoWNEEY_vDGSoRtkgJ_IGTUfOf3mYQPKNPhljXxNUfyZSpw7oBhD_RWFOnvP4tKUF7yrmexgg5Ol=w1280)\r\n\r\n## 11. Exploits\r\n\r\nYou now need to give the creature exploits. This is by far the most arbitrary part of the process. You should be inventive with its exploits - each creature should feel different. There’s a whole smorgasbord of area attacks, grabs, throws, mental attacks, psionic abilities, and more. Below is a small selection to get you started, but this is just the tip of the iceberg - it’s really important to note that this section is limited only by your imagination.\r\n\r\nFeel free to allow creatures to use exploits from other categories; these are listed thematically for convenience. Creatures and NPCs should also have access to regular exploits, and all have the ability to Aim or Feint.\r\n\r\nBelow, you will find a wide range of suggested exploits based on the creature's:\r\n\r\n- Type (e.g. insectoid, avian, mechanoid)\r\n- Role (e.g. brute, skirmisher, expert)\r\n- Career (e.g. enchanter, knight, noble)\r\n\r\nYou should select from any or all of these exploits, or create new exploits of your own devising.\r\n\r\n## 11.1. Creature Type\r\n\r\nThe creature’s type(s) also grant it some exploits or other adjustments. Apply these now.\r\n\r\n- - Aquatic. The creature gains a SWIM speed equal to its regular SPEED. It can breathe underwater. Swimming is a natural movement mode for aquatic creatures.\r\n    - Avian. The creature gains a FLY speed equal to its regular SPEED. Flying is a natural movement mode for avians.\r\n    - Beast. These are normal animals such as dogs, bears, and dinosaurs.\r\n    - Changeling.  A rare creature type, changelings are able to alter their shape and appearance. The exact details of this varies. They are typically immune to critical hits and conditions.\r\n    - Crystalline. Crystalline creatures are resistant to heat damage (SOAK 5 heat), but vulnerable (1d6) to sonic damage due to their brittle nature. They are immune to the Bleeding condition.\r\n    - Insectoid. Climbing is a natural movement mode for insectoids. The creature gains a CLIMB speed equal to its regular SPEED and does not need to make checks to climb. Such creatures can move on walls and ceilings normally.\r\n    - Humanoid. Humanoids gain no special advantages. They are bipedal, mammalian creatures.\r\n    - Gaseous. Gaseous creatures are immune to non energy-based physical attacks, and have SOAK 10 to energy-based attacks.\r\n    - Mechanoid. Mechanoids are immune to mental attacks, are vulnerable (1d6) to electricity damage, and vulnerable (2d6) to ion damage. They are usually immune to the Sick and Fatigued conditions.\r\n    - Plant. Plant creatures vulnerable (1d6) to fire, but have an additional 5 SOAK. Plants usually cannot wear armor. They are usually immune to the Sick and Fatigued conditions. They ignore natural difficult terrain, unless it is fire or heat-based.\r\n    - Projection. Projections are incorporeal entities, including psychic entities and holograms. Projections are incorporeal. This makes them immune to physical weapons unless they do psionic damage (in the case of a psychic entity) or ion damage (in the case of a hologram); they can pass through physical barriers. A projection will usually do psionic or electricity damage, if it does any damage. Projections cannot usually be killed; reducing them to 0 HEALTH simply disperses them for a while. Projections can freely fly, although many do not. Projections have superior darksight and lifesense to a distance of 5' per point of INT. Projections are usually immune to any physical conditions.\r\n    - Reptile. Reptiles are cold-blooded and are vulnerable (1d6) to cold damage. They usually have scales granting +5 natural SOAK.\r\n    - Swarm. A swarm is a collection of thousands of tiny creatures which attack en masse. A swarm is immune to all attacks except for area attacks. When it attacks, it simply moves into the target's square. Any creature which starts its turn in or enters the swarm's square suffers melee damage automatically, and may suffer the Blind condition. Swarms can move through gaps of any size.\r\n\r\n## 11.2. Role\r\n\r\nBelow is a selection of suggested exploits based on the creature's role.\r\n\r\nArtillery\r\n\r\n- Burst. This attack does burst damage (in a Burst equal to half MDP, so artillery with MDP 8 does a Burst 4). The attack attacks all creatures within the burst area (make only one attack roll and only one damage roll and apply it to all targets in the area). A psi-cop unleashes a psionic blast or soldier fires a grenade launcher.\r\n- Cone. Alternatively, the artillery could unleash a half MDP cone such as a breath weapon or flamethrower.\r\n\r\nBrute\r\n\r\n- Stop Right There! Enemies which try to move past the brute (move within reach) are subject to a free action attack, which stops their movement if successful.\r\n- Charge. The brute moves its SPEED and makes an attack with one action.\r\n- Burst. The brute uses an action to attack all adjacent targets. On a hit they are pushed back 10’.\r\n- Cone. Alternatively, this could be a cone such as a tail swipe.\r\n- Grab. This attack inflicts the Restrained condition on a creature, and requires a melee attack to escape. The brute’s natural damage is automatically inflicted at the start of the grabbed creature’s turns.\r\n- Hurl. Send a creature flying 3 squares plus one square per size difference and, do natural damage; this attack inflicts Downed condition.\r\n- Roar. This burst attack with a Burst equal to the brute’s MDP does a mental attack which inflicts the Afraid condition.\r\n- Trample. The brute can move through a smaller creature’s square, getting a free melee attack which knocks the target aside and prone for the attacker’s natural damage. If the attack misses, the brute must stop its movement.\r\n- Monstrous Leap. The brute leaps into the air a height of 5’ per MDP, making an attack against one foe it can reach while doing so.\r\n- Quake. The brute slams a foot, fist, or tail on the ground, shaking the area within its aura. The brute makes an attack against everybody within the area, knocking targets prone and doing 1d6 damage to them.\r\n- Monumental. The brute has double SOAK against ranged weapons.\r\n- Living Shield. The brute picks up another creature smaller than itself and uses it as a shield. The target can escape the grab as normal. Until then, the brute gains the protection of a shield of the same size category (e.g. a medium-sized creature is a medium shield). Additionally, attacks which miss but would have hit had the shield not been in place hit the grabbed creature instead.\r\n- Come Here! A target struck with a weapon or tentacle with a range equal to half its regular ranged attack range is pulled adjacent to the brute. The target cannot be larger than the brute.\r\n\r\nExpert\r\n\r\n- Skill dice. The expert’s primary skill dice pool is its MDP. It could be piloting, medicine, engineering, heraldry, or any other area of expertise.\r\n- Analyze. For one round the expert can remove one enemy’s SOAK. This only works on a given target once.\r\n- Healing. The expert can heal allies with an action equal to their damage roll. Each can only benefit once.\r\n\r\nNinja\r\n\r\n- Third attack. If the ninja makes two melee attacks, it gets a third attack for free.\r\n- Achilles heel. The ninja can bypass SOAK once per foe.\r\n- Dart In. The ninja moves its SPEED, attacks, then moves its SPEED back again.\r\n- Stealthy. The ninja can make MDP stealth checks to remain effectively invisible.\r\n- Teleport. The ninja can move a double move as one action. A psionic ninja teleports, special forces use transporter tech, a super-fast race zooms to a new location, or an alien simply makes a giant leap.\r\n- Poison. This attack inflicts the Poisoned or Sick conditions.\r\n\r\nSkirmisher\r\n\r\n- Perfect aim. The skirmisher gets +2d6 from aiming instead of +1d6.\r\n- Mobile attack. The skirmisher moves two moves and make a single ranged attack at any point.\r\n- Dive For Cover. On a missed attack, the skirmisher may use a reaction to move its SPEED and either get prone or behind cover.\r\n- Backpedal. When someone attempts a melee attack, the skirmisher use a reaction to step back 10’ and take a shot.\r\n- Panicked Unload. The skirmisher fires two shots at a target and if both hit, it gains a third shot.\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n\r\n- Healing. The support NPC can heal allies with an action an amount of HEALTH equal to their damage roll. Each can only benefit once.\r\n- Leadership. The support has a dice pool equal to its MDP to donate to its allies; it must declare this before any dice are rolled.\r\n- Designate target. The support chooses one target. That target may not benefit from cover until another target is selected. A spotlight illuminates the target or a commander uses a tactical battlefield targeting drone.\r\n- Battlefield control. The support can create difficult terrain or darkness in a burst area radius equal to its MDP. An ice cannon creates an icy patch, or an engineer throws caltrops\r\n- Summon. The support can summon, create, or activate activate 1d6 mooks. An engineer activates some security droids, or a commander summons some ninjas.\r\n\r\nTrickster\r\n\r\n- Teleport. The trickster can move a double move as one action, bypassing any obstacles.\r\n- Deceive. An illusion of self disguises the trickster’s true location.\r\n- Controller. A mental attack makes the target Charmed.\r\n- Taunt. A mental attack makes the target Angry.\r\n\r\nGeneral/Unusual\r\n\r\n- Aura. An aura equal to half the creature’s MDP does low damage or inflicts a condition.\r\n- Berserker. The creature gains +1d6 damage when below half HEALTH; it cannot stop attacking until all foes are dead.\r\n- Called Shot. The creature has a weakness which can be exploited via a Called Shot (-2d6 to hit). This might inflict a condition, or even kill it outright.\r\n- Disease. The creature inflicts a disease on a critical hit.\r\n- Poison. The creature inflicts the Poisoned condition on a hit.\r\n- Regeneration. The creature automatically heals a quarter MDP HEALTH at the start of each turn.\r\n\r\nRemember, this is just a small selection of ideas. You should try to vary your creatures as much as possible and design your own exploits.\r\n\r\n## 11.3. Careers\r\n\r\nYou can create goblin assassins, orc shamans, and fire dragon enchanters. The following exploits, attacks, and adjustments are suggestions in addition to the role-based exploit suggestions above. As always, you should feel free to arbitraily change anything to fit the concept you are building.\r\n\r\n1. A career often adds +1d6 or more to the creature’s Maximum Dice Pool.\r\n2. The creature gains +4 HEALTH, and an additional +4 HEALTH for each size category above medium, and +2 to each DEFENSE.\r\n3. The creature gains a career-relevant attack (noted below, along with a relevant icon).\r\n4. The creature gains an attribute increase to a relevant (noted) attribute if it does not have that attribute score or higher already.\r\n5. An attack or check directly related to the creature’s career (e.g. an archer firing an arrow, a firemage throwing a firebolt, or an enchanter controlling his victim’s mind) always uses the creature’s Maximum Dice Pool for the roll, even if the stat block would otherwise indicate something less. The creature’s career is the thing it is best at.\r\n6.

Animals & Careers\r\n\r\nYou can give an animal a career, creating polar bear illusionists, velociraptor pirates, even a shark druid. This also grants it an increase in LOG to 4 (if the career doesn't already grant a higher LOG score), and changes it to sentient.\r\n\r\n## 12. Skills\r\n\r\nYou will also need the monster’s skills. While most of the time you will just be using its derived statistics, occasionally you may need something more specific. These can be assigned arbitrarily. Here are some to consider:\r\n\r\n- - combat skill\\*- the monster equivalent of unarmed combat is simply called combat.\r\n    - perception- this may be named after the creature’s special senses, such as scent, hearing, etc., or it may just be called perception.\r\n    - movement skill\\*- this may be running or some similar skill.\r\n    - tactics or reactions - the monster should have one of these two skills.\r\n    - social skill(s)\\*- this optional skill, especially for tricksters and supporters, might includebluffing, intimidation, persuasion, and so on.\r\n    - stealth - most creatures will have this at some level, even if it is very low.\r\n    - psionic/magical skill(s)\\* - assign these if relevant, but most supernatural powers will be in the form of easy-to-use exploits.\r\n    - carrying - four-legged herbivores, and similar creatures, often have a dice pool in carrying equal to half their Maximum Dice Pool.\r\n\r\nYou should manually assign relevant skills. Remember that creatures can be naturally muchtter than humans at certain things, especially when it comes to senses, movement, and fighting. Don't be afraid to give them 10 or more ranks in something. If in doubt, compare them to an exceptional human (a professional athlete, for example), who would have 10 ranks or so. If the creature would be better than a trained athlete at a skill, then give it 10 or more ranks.\r\n\r\nIf in doubt, just give a creature a skill dice pool of half its Maximum Dice Pool.\r\n\r\n## 13. Finishing Up\r\n\r\nFinally, you will need to finish up with the minor (or not so minor!) details. You should feel free to tweak any values on the stat block - if your NPC is from a race of speedsters who only move at light speed, go ahead and give it a SPEED of 100, or whatever is appropriate. If your creature is reflective and immune to heat weapons, go ahead and add that immunity. Remember, as the GM, the monster is exactly what you need it to be.\r\n\r\nIf you are publishing the creature, it’s probably worth encoding those arbitrary changes as exploits, just so that others can see clearly where they came from, but this is not vital. And if you are only using it in your home game, it really doesn’t matter!",

          "Markdown": "# Customizing Monsters\r\n\r\nThe monsters in this book describe the basic creature, whether that be a mountain troll or a black orc, and are usually used as-is. However, you may wish to customize the monsters further. There are some simple tools to do this:\r\n\r\n- Paragons (+4d6). Paragon creatures are usually (though not always) single, unique examples and may represent the progenitor of a species. These creatures are truly epic.\r\n- Champions (+2d6). The goblin tribe may have a goblin king, or the champion fire dragon might be the most powerful of the species. While you can always use a different monster for such elite opponents, you can also turn a regular foe into a champions. Champions are  powerful opponents and represent some of the greatest of their type.\r\n- Greater creatures (+1d6). In other cases, the faceless soldiers may be led by an experienced commander. Greater creatures are elite or leader versions of regular creatures.\r\n- Lesser creatures (-2d6). If you simply need a weaker, or younger version of a creature, use this template. This can represent a young dragon or a knight’s squire.\r\n- Minions (+0d6). Sometimes the heroes need to plough through legions of bad guys, mowing down their foes with heroic ease. Whether they be goblins, ninjas, or other disposable henchmen, some foes’ role in the story is simply to let the protagonist show off. These are the minions.\r\n- Careers (+1d6). These simple templates, which are analogous to PC careers,  grant a creature a few special abilities.\r\n\r\nAny monster can use an of these template types. You can have a greater black orc (+1d6), a paragon t-rex (+4d6), a goblin minion, or a fire dragon enchanter (+1d6). You can even combine them, for a paragon hill giant berserker (+5d6). A creature can be simply referred to in this format in published material, succinctly providing the GM with all the information need. For example, you might see an encounter described thusly:\r\n\r\nOn the throne is Grimstab, a greater goblin shaman. He is surrounded by six minion goblin archers, while hiding in the shadows to one side is Jerlstaff, a goblin assassin.\r\n\r\n## Paragon (+4d6)\r\n\r\nThis creature is usually unique; a paragon fire dragon might be the progenitor of dragonkind. When designated as a paragon, the following changes are made:\r\n\r\n1. Paragon creatures have triple HEALTH and double SOAK.\r\n2. Paragon creatures add +4d6 to their Maximum Dice Pool.\r\n3. Paragon creatures use their Maximum Dice Pool for all checks, including attacks.\r\n4. Paragon creatures do double damage on all attacks.\r\n5. Paragons gain one extra action per round.\r\n\r\n## Champion (+2d6)\r\n\r\nThis might be a leader or champion. Or maybe it’s just a paragon of its species. A champion doesn’t have to have underlings; but they often do. A champion has the same stat block as a regular creature of its type. Any creature can be designated as a champion, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Champions have double HEALTH and +4 SOAK (to a maximum of double SOAK).\r\n2. Champions add +2d6 to their Maximum Dice Pool.\r\n3. Champions get +2d6 to all attribute checks, including attacks.\r\n4. Champions deal an extra 2d6 damage on a successful single-target attack, or an extra 1d6 damage on a successful area attack.\r\n5. Once per round, when a champion has an adjacent minion, it can make that minion take the damage from an attack which should normally have hit the champion. The minion is immediately killed.\r\n\r\n## Greater (+1d6)\r\n\r\nThis might be a larger version of a creature, or a more experienced example. A greater creature has the same stat block as a regular creature of its type. Any creature can be designated as “greater”, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Greater creatures have 150% HEALTH and +2 SOAK.\r\n2. Greater creatures add +1d6 to their Maximum Dice Pool.\r\n3. Greater creatures get +1d6 to all attribute checks, including attacks.\r\n4. Greater creatures deal an extra 1d6 damage on a successful single-target attack.\r\n\r\n## Lesser (-2d6)\r\n\r\nThe dragon guards its youngling against the adventurers. One of the hill giants is weaker than the others, and his companions bully him mercilessly. These are younger or weaker versions of monsters, but they’re not cannon-fodder like minions. Any creature can be designated as “lesser”, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Lesser creatures have half HEALTH.\r\n2. Lesser creatures have -2d6 to their Maximum Dice Pool, but cannot be reduced below 3d6.\r\n3. Lesser creatures get -2d6 to all attribute checks, including attacks.\r\n4. Lesser creatures do half damage on all attacks.\r\n5. Lesser creatures are one size category smaller than the regular creature, although this does not otherwise affect its statistics.\r\n\r\n## Minion (+0d6)\r\n\r\nMinions may be faceless minions, or the horde that surrounds the evil mastermind. A minion has the same stat block as a regular creature of its type, whether that be a bandit, a guard, a goblin, or an orc. Any creature can be designated a minion, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A minion is automatically killed with a single hit which exceeds its SOAK.\r\n2. When two or more minions are adjacent to a more powerful foe, each minion automatically deals 1 point of non-SOAKable damage (although this does not circumvent immunities) to the target at the beginning of its turn. In this way, mobs of minions can slowly bring down a more powerful foe while being easily dispatched one at a time.\r\n3. When a greater creature is killed, minions tend to break and flee. If a minion witnesses the death of an allied greater creature, it will stop fighting. It will flee if possible, and surrender if not. If there is still a greater creature remaining (i.e. there were multiple greater creatures to begin with), half of the minions will break, while the other half continues to fight. Determine which minions flee and which minions fight randomly.\r\n\r\nAs the PCs increase in grade, so does the pool of available minions. To appropriately powerful PCs, even trolls, vampire spawn, and velociraptors might eventually qualify as minions, at the GM’s discretion.\r\n\r\n## Zinhorn the Champion Tyrannosaur Druid\r\n\r\nThis is an example of a champion tyrannosaur druid. It uses the tyrannosaur as the base monster with the champion template and the druid suggestions from the [monster creation guidelines](/bestiary/creating-monsters).\r\n\r\n### Zinhorn\r\n\r\nEnormous sentient reptile (14d6)\r\nSTR 28 (7d6) AGI 10 (4d6) END 28 (7d6)INT 10 (4d6) LOG 4 (2d6) WIL 21 (6d6) CHA 10 (4d6) LUC 3 (2d6) REP 21 (6d6)\r\nMELEE DEFENCE 40RANGED DEFENCE 14MENTAL DEFENCE 22VITAL DEFENCE 48\r\nHEALTH 330SOAK 27; VULN 1d6 coldIMMUNE none\r\nINITIATIVE 8d6PERCEPTION 5d6 (motion 7d6)SPEED 6; CLIMB -; JUMP -CARRY 560lb (max lift 1400lb)\r\nREACH 10-ftACTIONS 3\r\n🅜 Bite 13d6 melee (8d6+7 piercing damage)🅜 Tail swipe 11d6 melee (6d6 blunt damage; cone 6)🅥 Entangle 14d6 vital (range 10; restrained)\r\nSkills combat 10 (4d6), hearing 3 (2d6), reactions 3 (2d6), hunting 10 (4d6)\r\n\r\n## ──────────\r\n\r\n                                                               Charge. Once per turn, Zinhorn can move its speed in a straight line and then attack at the end of it, all as a single action. It  gains +1d6 damage to its attack.\r\nRoar. Zinhorn can unleash a roar so loud that its victims are stricken with fear.  A roar is an 8d6 mental attack, and attacks any creature within Burst 11. Victims successfully attacked are rendered Afraid.\r\nTail swipe. Zinhorn has a tail swipe attack. This attack affects all targets in a 30' cone to the rear of the creature.\r\nMinions. Once per round, when Zinhorn has an adjacent minion, it can make that minion take the damage from an attack which should normally have hit Zinhorn. The minion is immediately killed.\r\nMovement. Zinhorn can move through woodland areas and thick undergrowth without any speed reduction, and leave no tracks or traces of its passing unless it chooses to do so.\r\nShapechange. Zinhorn may transform into a small or medium-sized animal (and back again) once per day for up to one hour. It cannot speak in this form, and retains its own mental attributes, but otherwise uses the animal’s statistics.\r\nEntangle. Zinhorn can inflct the Restrained condition on a foe within 10 squares.",

While these can be broken down into numerous smaller ages, this is not necessary to play the game.\r\n\r\nEach of the three standalone books, O.L.D., N.O.W., and N.E.W., presents a single era in detail.\r\n\r\nArchaic.  This era covers the stone age, all the way through medieval times, up to the rennaissance and introduction of early firearms. It features swords, elves, and dragons.  It is covered in detail in [O.L.D.](https://enpublishingrpg.com/collections/whats-old-is-new-woin/products/o-l-d-the-fantasy-heroic-roleplaying-game-v1-2) which focuses on medieval fantasy.\r\n\r\nModern.

In terms of what technology to include, the default rule (unless the setting says otherwise) is that any technology from an earlier era is available in a later era at double the price, and that technology from a later era is not available in a previous era.  These items are designated archaic, modern, and future in this rules reference document.\r\n\r\nThe three supernatural elements - magic, chi, and psionics, can each be included in any of these eras.\r\n\r\n# \r\n\r\nAdvancement Level\r\n\r\n## 0.

These two pieces of information are all that is needed to determine an inanimate object's DEFENSE, HEALTH, and SOAK.\r\n\r\n## HEALTH\r\n\r\nThe health of an object is simply the square root of its weight in pounds (if known). If the exact weight is not known, use the average figures below. An object is broken when reduced to half HEALTH and destroyed when reduced to zero. This does not apply to creatures or characters, whose HEALTH is based on other attributes.\r\n\r\n## DEFENSE\r\n\r\nAn object's DEFENSE is based on its size.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/v-x8Er9kus5MdCz4dujIEAVtgqzDNaLJco263cc0mKj32wWj5c2iNjwIKmlFgGgMEIjSI9GzjrgPHJpOsX8X4Ok24b09QuSBk23SZ4nR-qBhmBLv=w1280)\r\n\r\n## SOAK\r\n\r\nAn object's SOAK is based on the material it is made of.

          "Markdown": "# Environment\r\n\r\nAdventurers can’t always rely on the fact that they’ll be in a comfortable, temperate environment. Deserts, volcano bases, mountaintops, howling storms, blizzards, driving rain, underwater lairs, and more can contrive to create a wide array of environments and can make for extremely memorable set-piece battles.\r\n\r\nThe following environmental templates can be applied to areas the size of a world or as small as part of a room.\r\n\r\nEnvironments sometimes inflict a persistent condition, such as Sick or Fatigued, which only wears off after a night’s sleep. If a condition mentions that it applies after an hour, it is considered a persistent condition.\r\n\r\nAreas can have more than one environmental type. For example, an arctic wasteland might be cold and windy.\r\n\r\nSome creatures are immune to certain environments. SOAK 5 (or more) of an appropriate damage type (where relevant) makes a creature immune to a condition. Some abilities or exploits may also provide condition immunity.\r\n\r\nAn environment doesn’t typically inflict actual damage. Anything in the environment that’s dangerous enough to inflict damage (such as an actual fire, lava pit, pool of acid, liquid nitrogen, etc.) is a hazard and can do direct damage to those who touch it. Environments do not have such extreme effects, can typically be traversed, but may have effects if characters spend too long in them.\r\n\r\nEnvironment types have the following characteristics.\r\n\r\n## Acidic\r\n\r\nAcidic environments can be caused by acid rain or chemical smoke. An acidic environment causes irritation and pain. Those who spend more than an hour in an acidic environment suffer the Pained condition.\r\n\r\n## Cold\r\n\r\nFrom arctic wastelands to ice dragon lairs, cold environments can be debilitating and deadly. After an hour, cold environments inflict the Slow condition due to sluggish reactions and slowing metabolisms. Note that 5 points of cold SOAK, such as that from protective gear, protects from cold.\r\n\r\n## Difficult Terrain\r\n\r\nSnow, mud, rubble, debris, swamp, shallow water, deep undergrowth, and more can create difficult terrain. Difficult terrain halves ground movement SPEED.\r\n\r\n## Dim/Smoky/Rain/Snow\r\n\r\nDim light, obviously caused by a lack of light, can also represent smoky, snowy, or raining environments where vision is compromised. Dim light renders a creature which starts its turn in the area Blind (although this does not progress beyond the first stage); darker areas inflict the severe Blind condition automatically unless the creature has some way of illuminating the area or seeing in the dark. Unlike other environmental effects, this wears off as soon as the environmental effect goes away.\r\n\r\n## Hot\r\n\r\nFrom hot volcanic ninja lairs to burning warehouses, a hot environment is an environment similar to that of a desert; somewhere in the region of 100+ degrees Fahrenheit (or 45 degrees Celsius). It causes Fatigue after an hour. A scorching environment is significantly hotter, and burns those within it; those who begin their turn in a scorching area gain the Burning condition.\r\n\r\n## Radioactive\r\n\r\nRadioactive areas are very dangerous. Those who begin their turn in a radioactive area gain the Sick condition. Those who spend an hour in the area contract radiation sickness (see the section on illnesses and diseases).\r\n\r\n## Slippery\r\n\r\nA slippery area, caused by things like icy ground or an oil slick, counts as difficult terrain (half SPEED).\r\n\r\n## Thick/Thin Atmosphere\r\n\r\nWhile both thick and thin atmospheres are very dissimilar, their effects on creatures are not so different. Both types of atmosphere can quickly tire a creature not used to it; after an hour, creatures gain the Fatigued condition.\r\n\r\n## Tremors\r\n\r\nUnstable environments could be caused by earthquakes, sailing ships under extreme fire, or buildings about to explode. Tremors count as difficult terrain (half SPEED). At the start of each round, all creatures must make a Routine [10] AGI check or fall prone. Quakes make for an extremely difficult environment—horizontal movement is counted as climbing—and the AGI check is Difficult [16] and additionally inflicts 2d6 blunt damage on a failure (as well as knocking the creature prone).\r\n\r\n## Underwater\r\n\r\nAn underwater environment eliminates all fire-based effects, reduces fire damage from weapons and spells by –1d6, increases electricity damage by +1d6, and counts as difficult terrain. It is also airless (see suffocation, under thick/thin atmospheres).\r\n\r\n## Vacuum\r\n\r\nA vacuum is an area with no atmosphere. It is a myth that vacuums cause spontaneous explosion of human tissue, although exposure is certainly not healthy.\r\n\r\nThe biggest danger from a vacuum is simply the lack of air. Without some way to breathe, living creatures in a vacuum will quickly suffocate. Lack of oxygen uses a similar process to that when an unconscious character is dying. Create a countdown dice pool equal in size to the character’s END attribute. Each turn, the dice pool is rolled and any 6s rolled are removed from the pool. When the final die is removed, the character falls unconscious and the unconscious and dying process begins as normal.\r\n\r\n## Wet\r\n\r\nA wet environment is a humid or rainy one—tropical jungles, aboard a sailing ship, in driving rain. In these environments, the Burning condition has no effect and fire-based weapons cannot cause critical hits.\r\n\r\n## Windy\r\n\r\nWindy environments are caused by rushing air (or other gases). Wind always has a direction of movement, which is determined beforehand. Moving into the wind counts as difficult terrain. In a hurricane, it is harder— to move into the wind, a Challenging [13] STR check is required. Additionally, at the start of every turn, all creatures must make a Challenging [13] STR check or be pushed 1d6 squares in the direction of the wind.",

          "Markdown": "# Vehicle Combat\r\n\r\nSometimes characters will engage in combat from aboard a vehicle; this may involve vehicles fighting each other, or pedestrians fighting against or with vehicles. Vehicles follow the following rules when involved in a combat situation.\r\n\r\nVehicles are placed on the battlemap, and usually take up two or more squares (motorcycles only take up one square). A vehicle’s stats indicate the number of occupants (including the driver) it may carry.\r\n\r\nThe vehicle is essentially an extension of its driver. It acts on the driver’s Initiative, and moves on the driver’s turn. Other occupants act on their own turns, as normal. However, passengers move for free automatically with the vehicle, as you would expect.\r\n\r\n## Initiative\r\n\r\nThe driver rolls Initiative as normal. The vehicle’s Handling score provides a bonus or penalty to the driver’s Initiative roll.\r\n\r\nHandling \t\tInitiative\r\n\r\n1 \t\t\t\t+1d6\r\n\r\n2 \t\t\t\t+1d6\r\n\r\n3 \t\t\t\t—\r\n\r\n4 \t\t\t\t—\r\n\r\n5 \t\t\t\t–1d6\r\n\r\n6 \t\t\t\t–2d6\r\n\r\n## Movement\r\n\r\nA vehicle moves forward on its driver’s turn. The driver spends one of their actions driving the vehicle. The passengers do not need to spend actions to move, as they move for free with the vehicle.\r\n\r\nA vehicle moves its current velocity; on the driver’s turn, as part of his driving action, they may increase or decrease the vehicle’s velocity by an amount up to its Acceleration score. For example, if the vehicle is moving at Speed 10, and has an Accel of 3, they may brake and reduce the Speed to 7, or they may put theirs foot down and increase it to 13. The vehicle cannot move faster than the Speed score listed in its stat block.\r\n\r\n## Turning\r\n\r\nThe driver may turn the vehicle. They may alter its course by up to 45 degrees. Every vehicle has a turning circle which indicates how many squares it must move forward before making a turn; as long as the vehicle follows this rule, leaving the requisite amount of squares between turns of up to 45 degrees, it may turn as often in a round as the driver wishes.\r\n\r\nA vehicle’s turning circle is equal to its current speed multiplied by its Handling, divided by 5 (round down to a minimum of 1). A Handling 3 car moving at a velocity of 6 has a turning circle of (3 x 6) ÷ 5 = 3. A smaller Handling 1 motorcycle moving at the same velocity has a turning circle of just 1 hex, while a Handling 5 truck at that speed has a turning circle of 6.\r\n\r\n## Actions\r\n\r\nThe occupants of a vehicle can act as normal. They may shoot with handheld weapons normally, or they can use vehicle-mounted weapons (using the gunnery skill); or, of course, they can take any other action they are capable of.\r\n\r\nThe driver must use one of their actions moving the vehicle (unless it is stationary); they can use their  remaining action as they wish. However, any action taken while driving suffers a -2d6 complication penalty.\r\n\r\n## Firing Weapons\r\n\r\nWeapons can be operated by vehicle occupants. Weapons have a firing arc, unless they are turreted, granting a 360-degree firing arc. Line of sight is required unless the weapon is designated Artillery. Some weapons are linked, which means one occupant fires both at the same time.\r\n\r\nAn occupant uses Agility or Intuition to fire (as normal), and applies the usual range increment penalties. Attacks are made against the target vehicle’s Defense; vehicles add their current speed to their Defense score, making fast-moving vehicles harder to hit.\r\n\r\nWeapon damage is reduced by a vehicle’s SOAK and then applied to its HEALTH.\r\n\r\n### Vehicle Movement Modifiers to Hit\r\n\r\nSituation \t\t\t\t\t\tModifier\r\n\r\nStationary target\t\t\t\t +1d6\r\n\r\nRear attack \t\t\t\t\t+1d6\r\n\r\nForward-mounted weapons +1d6\r\n\r\nPer range increment \t\t\t–1d6\r\n\r\nAft-mounted weapons \t\t–1d6\r\n\r\nShooting at occupants. If a vehicle’s occupant is targeted by a weapon, the occupant gains the benefit of the vehicle’s Soak score or his own Soak score, whichever is higher, and uses his own Ranged Defense score or the vehicle’s (whichever is higher—remember, the vehicle adds its current speed to its Defense score). Occupants also have cover (–2d6 to hit) unless they are on a motorcycle or other open vehicle.\r\n\r\n## Critical hits\r\n\r\nCritical hits work slightly differently when a vehicle is the target. Roll on the following table when a critical hit is scored.\r\n\r\n2d6 \tLocation \t\tEffect\r\n\r\n2 \t\tWeapon \t\tWeapon is damaged and inoperable\r\n\r\n3 \t\tTire \t\t\tSpin out (see below)\r\n\r\n4 \t\tEngine \t\tReduce max Speed by 1d6\r\n\r\n5 \t\tDriver \t\t1d6 damage to driver (no Soak)\r\n\r\n6 \t\tWindshield \tReduce Handling by 1 class\r\n\r\n7 \t\tChassis \t\tNo additional effect\r\n\r\n8 \t\tPassenger \t1d6 damage to passenger (no Soak)\r\n\r\n9 \t\tFuel tank \t\tVehicle catches fire, taking 1d6 damage each round; roll to end this condition as you would any other condition.\r\n\r\n10 \t\tEngine \t\tReduce Accel by 1.\r\n\r\n11 \t\tTire \t\t\tSpin out (see below).\r\n\r\n12 \t\tWeapon \t\tWeapon is damaged and inoperable.\r\n\r\n## Collisions\r\n\r\nThere are four types of collisions: head-on, rear-end, T‑bone, and sideswipe. When a collision takes place, all vehicles spin out unless the driver makes a successful check (see below). Both vehicles take damage equal to three times the collision speed:\r\n\r\n- Head-on. Two vehicles collide and each is in the other’s front arc. Add their current speeds together.\r\n- Rear-end. A vehicle collides with the rear arc of another vehicle. Deduct the black vehicle’s speed from the red vehicle’s speed.\r\n- T-bone. A vehicle collides with the side arc of another vehicle. Use the speed of the red car.\r\n- Sideswipe. The result of a maneuver in which two vehicles collide with the side arcs of each other. Use half of the faster vehicle’s speed.\r\n\r\n## Spinning Out\r\n\r\nSpinning out occurs when:\r\n\r\n1. The driver is injured.\r\n\r\n2. A tire is damaged.\r\n\r\n3. A collision takes place.\r\n\r\n4. The vehicle enters or begins its turn on slippery terrain (oil slicks, ice, etc.)\r\n\r\n5. After a jump.\r\n\r\nThe driver may attempt to prevent the vehicle from spinning out by making an AGI check (bolstered by their driving skill, if they have it) with a difficulty equal to three times the vehicle’s current speed.\r\n\r\nIf the vehicle spins out, it comes to a stop in a randomly determined square half its current speed from the point where it span out. Also roll 1d6; on a roll of 5, it ends up on its side, and on a 6 it ends up upside down.\r\n\r\nA vehicle which spins out causes 1d6 damage to all occupants. This damage cannot be SOAKed.\r\n\r\n## Stunts\r\n\r\nA number of maneuvers are available as exploits, including emergency stop, handbrake turn (J-turn), and more. The driver may use his action to perform these exploits.\r\n\r\nAll vehicles can attempt a jump as long as a ramp is present. The vehicle jumps as part of its Speed (it cannot accelerate or decelerate while airborne), but the maximum distance it can jump is equal to its half its current speed divided by its Handling (round down). For example, a generic compact automobile moving at Speed 12 with Handling 3 can jump 2 squares, while a motorcycle moving at Speed 18 with Handling 1 can jump 9 squares.\r\n\r\nJumping is one thing, however. Landing is another. A vehicle automatically spins out (see above) when it lands after a jump, unless the driver is able to prevent it from doing so.",

As a free reaction, the wearer can use the shield to absorb some or all of the damage of an elemental attack directed against her up to three times per day. The type of element must be selected at the time of enchantment. This property can be taken multiple times, and each time the shield gains +4 Soak versus that elemental damage type.\r\n\r\nKingly (2,000 gc). A kingly shield has an elaborate enchanted rune or motif design which inspires allies. Once per day, the wearer can use an action to raise the shield aloft and inspire allies within 30', all of whom gain +1d6 to their next attribute check made within one minute.\r\n\r\nMirrored (1,000 gc). A mirrored shield has a very highly polished metal surface. The wearer can reflect light at a foe by making an attack with the shield; if successful, the target gains the Blind condition. This property only works in areas of bright light.\r\n\r\nMithril (base cost × 10). This customization can only be applied at the time of forging, and can only be applied to metal shields. Shields made of mithril gain +2 Defense, are able to hold two additional enchantments, cannot be destroyed, and will never dull. Mithril shields can never be lower than exceptionalquality. Mithril is a silver-colored metal mined by dwarves.\r\n\r\nReflector (5,000 gc). A shield must be mirrored to receive this enchantment. Once per day, the wearer can reflect a spell cast at him back at the caster as a free reaction. This property can be taken multiple times; the ability works against spells of 3 MP for each time the property is taken (so taking it 3 times makes it effective against spells of 9 MP).\r\n\r\nSpikes/Knobs (100 gc). Metal spikes or knobs can be added to a shield to aid in its use as an offensive item. This increases the damage inflicted by the shield by +1d6. Spikes change the damage from blunt to piercing.\r\n\r\nWeightless (5,000 gc). Weightless shields are enchanted so that they do not hinder the wearer at all. The shield weighs 0 lbs. when worn.",

If you are using magic to accomplish a task which already has a difficulty value associated with it (such as unlocking a cell door, lifting a fallen tree), then you will need to make a POW attribute check at that same difficulty. If the action would not normally attract an attribute check, such as washing the dishes or closing a window, then neither does the magical action.\r\n\r\nAttacks. If you are attacking a creature with your magic, you will need to make a POW attribute check vs. its relevant DEFENSE. An unwilling target always requires an attribute check or attack.\r\n\r\n## Skills\r\n\r\nJust like with any other attribute check, you can combine your POW check with a relevant skill. This increases the size of your dice pool as normal (and therefore the maximum number of PP you can spend on a spell).\r\n\r\nAbjuration (for protection)\r\n\r\nDisplacement (for moving things)\r\n\r\nEnchantment (for controlling creatures)\r\n\r\nEvocation (for blasting stuff)\r\n\r\nHealing (for curing wounds)\r\n\r\nSummoning (for summoning creatures)\r\n\r\nThe full rules contain a much wider array of magical skills.\r\n\r\n## Spell Statistics\r\n\r\nThe statistics of your spell are based on the number of Power Points you spend. You can spend Power Points to increase your spell’s range, area, damage, duration, and other values. The table below shows how many Power Points you need to spend to achieve each effect. You must spend at least 1 PP to cast a spell.\r\n\r\nYou must purchase each statistic separately–so for 6 PP you might spend 3 PP on range and 3 PP on damage, or you might spend 2 PP on range, 2 PP on area, and 2 PP on damage.\r\n\r\nRange/Area. The maximum range of your spells is determined by the number of Power Points you spend, and you can affect an area with a maximum diameter also determined by your Power Points.\r\n   Movement. You can move a creature or object which fits within the area of your spell, including yourself, anywhere within range of your spell. The form of the movement is based on your theme–perhaps you are born aloft by insects, or you telekinetically lift a rock. The movement is physical.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to teleport instead, it must be to a location you can see, and the maximum range is halved.\r\n\r\nDuration. You can affect one person or object for an amount of time based on the PP you spend, or you can divide that duration between multiple people or targets within the spell’s area.\r\n\r\nA duration of ‘concentration’ means that the spell lasts for as long as you concentrate on it, which uses both of your actions for the round.\r\n\r\nDamage & healing. Your PP expenditure determines the total amount of damage you can inflict or heal. This damage or healing can be applied to one target or divided between multiple targets within the area. If a duration is specified, the damage is divided equally across that duration. The damage type is determined by your theme.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, for 3 PP you can inflict or remove a condition such as blinded or charmed.\r\n\r\nProtection. You can bestow SOAK for the duration of the spell. If your SOAK only applies to one damage type, you can increase the protection by +1d6 for free. It’s up to you what this looks like–a ghostly shield or suit of armor, a protective sphere, or perhaps your skin takes on the semblance of stone.\r\n\r\nSummoning. You can summon a creature with a RANK equal to or less than that indicated by your PP expenditure, or multiple creatures whose combined RANKs are equal to or less than that RANK. The creature acts independently, will be allied with you until it vanishes or leaves at the end of the spell’s duration, and you do not control it unless you spend PP on control effects.\r\n\r\nControl. You can compel or control a creature of the same RANK that you can summon one.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have a POW dice pool of 4d6 or more, by spending 4 PP you can:\r\n\r\n- Make a ranged attack to throw a bolt of fire at a zombie 30 feet away and do 2d6 fire damage.\r\n- Heal 2d6 HEALTH divided between allies within a 20' diameter area.\r\n- Summon a woodland critter for 1 minute.\r\n- Protect yourself with SOAK 1d6 for the same amount of time, or with SOAK 2d6 for fire damage only.\r\n- Teleport yourself 50'.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/s8B-T4qq6u44s2wgQuK4vNTkfRrlDgW4fBzIhCCKNxhLfE7D6gGdDEBBPTzvqwt2rjg7tmvrbKSA1R9KF3skhxTjGzyILksYnNcmZ3uCx3KKzBlIFW1ysDew7ej0AY8Iiw=w1280)\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pkQQsSmOB82UoYj-smKmm_KnJuGZ9Uu_swkXfAqaZSgU8kcQ_w38dOjP7kVdL51j3dT-MSvyJXwExYhzi6FCk39ogSoY5iFomHmgdFG4o7bPQ2bzp8F7r6zFi9PsKXTuPg=w1280)",

Any character can attempt to use alchemy in order to solve a problem or achieve a goal. Alchemy often involves at least a touch of magic. As an extended skill task, alchemy is used for more mundane chemical purposes. Examples of mundane uses of alchemy include:\r\n\r\n- Removing a permanent condition.\r\n- Melting a lock with acid.\r\n- Treating a disease.\r\n- Create a strong glue.\r\n- Creating a poison or an antidote (for poisons, an opposed task is needed vs. the target’s Defense, assuming the poison can be delivered in food or drink; it does 2d6 poison damage plus 1d6 for each complexity level used, which means that the longer you spend making a poison, the more deadly it is).\r\n- Burn or combust materials like metal and stone.\r\n\r\nLike herbs, alchemical concoctions can also be used to inflict conditions, thus creating a love potion or a sleep draught. The concoction must be delivered (imbibed by the target, or similar). A concoction which is eaten or drunk is an hourly task, a poultice, salve, or ointment is a daily task, and a gas, incense, or smoke is a weekly task.\r\n\r\nThe traditional, legendary uses of alchemy (transforming lead into gold, or creating an elixir of immortality) are covered in the magic rules.\r\n\r\nIf the concoction needs a duration (such as an antidote that will protect the imbiber from a certain poison), the duration equals one time increment of the extended task. Characters can choose to increase the tasks’s complexity (say, from hourly to daily) in order to gain a longer duration.\r\n\r\nThe check is a simple opposed one vs. the target’s Defense or Mental Defense, and success inflicts a condition, with a critical success inflicting a severe condition.\r\n\r\nThe players start by declaring their intentions. This goal may be anything they wish, although they may find some goals too hard to accomplish. It might be to devise an acid to melt the lock on a cell door, save an ally who has been turned to stone by a gorgon, or build an explosive. The GM sets the difficulty as normal, and characters may attempt LOGIC checks until they have reached the target number of successes (typically three successes). The complexity and duration of the task are established as normal. Alchemy is a classic example of a very simple use of the extended task mechanism.\r\n\r\nAlchemy is an acceptable way to accomplish many tasks, even if other methods are available. A locked door can be picked or hacked by a burglar, or an alchemist might attempt to open it by melting the lock with alchemical acid. The difficulty of the task does not change—if it’s a Difficult [16] task to pick the lock, then it’s a Difficult [16] alchemical task also.\r\n\r\n## Poison Crafting\r\n\r\nTime \t\tPoison\r\n\r\n1 minute \t2d6\r\n\r\n1 hour \t3d6\r\n\r\n1 day \t\t4d6\r\n\r\n1 week \t5d6\r\n\r\n1 month \t6d6",

          "Markdown": "# Chases\r\n\r\nCommon skills: running, driving, piloting, jumping, climbing, stealth, bluffing, swimming.\r\n\r\nA chase is an opposed extended task. The first to reach six wins is the winner of a chase situation (although the GM can modify this for longer or shorter chases). Multiple people can be involved in a chase, each making their own checks.\r\n\r\nA simple foot chase simply involves STR or AGI checks, along with the running skill. A vehicle chase may instead use AGI and driving, or a starfighter chase may use AGI and piloting.\r\n\r\nA more complex chase involves other skills. The target chooses the action (they might elect to climb a wall, dive into an asteroid field, jump a canyon, and so on), and the pursuers must match it. Examples of actions can be seen below.\r\n\r\n### Foot chases\r\n\r\n- - Climb a wall (climbing vs. climbing)\r\n    - Jump an alleyway (jumping vs. jumping)\r\n    - Disappear into a crowd (stealth vs. perception)\r\n    - Swim a river (swimming vs. swimming)\r\n    - Squeeze through a tight gap (acrobatics vs. acrobatics)\r\n    - Balance along a narrow ledge (acrobatics or climbing)\r\n    - Use a hidden shortcut (local knowledge vs perception)\r\n    - Cause a distraction (bluff vs. perception)\r\n    - Cause an obstruction or obstacle (varies)\r\n    - Duck into a blind alley (stealth vs. perception)\r\n    - Get somebody to give the pursuers false directions (bluffing vs. local knowledge)\r\n\r\n### Vehicle chases\r\n\r\n- - Jump a canyon (driving vs. driving)\r\n    - Fly though a twisting canyon (piloting vs. piloting)\r\n    - “Ski” a vehicle through a narrow gap (driving vs. driving)\r\n\r\n### Space chases\r\n\r\n- - Dive into an asteroid field (piloting vs. piloting)\r\n    - Hide in a nebula (stealth vs. computers)\r\n\r\n## Speed\r\n\r\nDifferent characters, creatures, vehicles, and ships have different speeds. While skill is the most important factor, speed is also very important. Anybody involved in a race or a chase can add +1d6 to their checks if they have a Speed of 10 or more, and +2d6 if they have a Speed of 20 or more.\r\n\r\n## Random Terrain\r\n\r\nOne way to adjudicate a chase is to randomly determine terrain and obstacles at each stage. Some basic examples using 2d6 can be seen below, although you are encouraged to devise your own tables tailored to your setting. Each obstacle gives the participants opportunity to devise how to use or circumvent them.\r\n\r\nYou may allow a PC an automatic win if they have a way to circumvent an obstacle which their opponent lacks— a PC with a jet pack automatically succeeds at crossing a canyon, for example.\r\n\r\n2d6 \tFoot, Urban \t\t\tFoot, Wilderness \t\t\tVehicle \t\t\t\t\t\tSpace\r\n\r\n2 \t\tSlick footing \t\t\tCliff \t\t\t\t\t\tBroken bridge \t\t\t\tTemporal distortion\r\n\r\n3 \t\tGap/hole \t\t\t\tMud patch \t\t\t\tConstruction work \t\t\tGravitic anomoly\r\n\r\n4 \t\tBarrels or crates \t\tSteep incline \t\t\t\tHairpin bend \t\t\t\t\tUnusual star\r\n\r\n5 \t\tTwisting alleyways \tDense trees \t\t\t\tSlow-moving vehicles \t\tAsteroid field\r\n\r\n6 \t\tSlow passing vehicle \tTangled undergrowth \tCrates and barrels \t\t\tDebris\r\n\r\n7 \t\tStraight \t\t\t\tStraight \t\t\t\t\tStraight \t\t\t\t\t\tStraight\r\n\r\n8 \t\tWall \t\t\t\t\tRock formation \t\t\tBusy junction \t\t\t\tNebula\r\n\r\n9 \t\tLadder \t\t\t\tUnsure footing \t\t\tCanyon \t\t\t\t\t\tGas cloud\r\n\r\n10 \t\tCrowded street \t\tRiver \t\t\t\t\t\tMarket square \t\t\t\tConvoy\r\n\r\n11 \t\tShortcut \t\t\t\tAnimal herd \t\t\t\tChildren in the road \t\t\tWandering comet\r\n\r\n12 \t\tPool/river \t\t\tCanyon \t\t\t\t\tFuneral procession \t\t\tShip graveyard",

The goal is to extract information from a subject. Unlike many extended tasks, an interrogation can continue indefinitely. However, each time a questioner loses an opposed check, the task complexity increases from quick to hourly to daily, and so on, meaning that the time required gets longer and longer.\r\n\r\nA simple interrogation involves CHA vs. WIL checks, along with the interrogation skill. That skill is used to both conduct and withstand interrogation. Each time the interrogator makes a check, they ask a question. If they win the opposed check, the subject answers truthfully; if they fail, the subject lies or refuses to answer, and the complexity of the task incceases by one stage.\r\n\r\nThe answer can be no more than a short sentence – the interrogator can’t ask “Whatis your entire plan, in full detail?” The GMshould hide the subject’s die rolls; theinterrogator does not know if the subjectis lying (unless they have a relevant psionic power or an interrogation kit).\r\n\r\nIn modern or future settings, interrogation kits indicate when a subject is lying (although the subject may make an opposed CHA vs. INT check, using the bluffing skill if they have it, to deceive the interrogation kit), as well as granting possible bonuses to checks.

Of course, a subject cannot reveal information they do not have.\r\n\r\nEach use of an interrogation kit causes 1d6 damage to the subject.\r\n\r\nMore advanced interrogations may use other skills, including persuasion, bluffing, even seduction.",

          "Markdown": "# Scanning\r\n\r\nCommon skills: computers, medicine, chemistry, biology, mining.\r\n\r\nUsing a scanner is a simple, single-check task. Characters can use a hand-held scanner to obtain information about a target or the surroundings. All scanners operate in a similar way, although starship sensors (which are essentially giant scanner arrays with immense range) are dealt with in more detail [here](/space/sensors). Basic use of a scanner uses the computers skill, but subject-specific skills like medicine or chemistry can also be used to reveal detailed information.\r\n\r\nWhen operating a scanner, the character may ask one closed question which the GM will answer. The question must fall within the equipment’s area of focus (a medical scanner can’t detect mineral deposits, and a mining scanner can’t diagnose an illness, for example), but other than that any question may be asked. Each question is one use of the scanner, and takes one action.\r\n\r\nTo use a scanner, make a Routine [10] LOG check. Scanners have a 10’ range increment, much like a weapon’s range increment; each increment inflicts a -1d6 die penalty to the dice pool. High quality scanners, of course, add to the dice pool, as do related skills. Before using the scanner, the user must set the scanning range, which determines the dice pool penalty if there is one. The penalty applies to all scans made at that range setting, even if the information gathered pertains to something closer. The scanner will not reveal information about things beyond that range.\r\n\r\nMedical scanner. These scanners only provide information about biological and medical issues. They can be used to diagnose a disease, or provide information about a lifeform. Medical scanners can use any medical or bio skills – medicine, biology, zoology, genetics, zoology, xenobiology, or even psychology.\r\n\r\nMining scanner. Also known as geological scanners, these scanners provide information about substances and structures. They analyse chemicals, minerals, and materials. Mining scanners can use skills like mining, chemistry, and geology. Mining scanners are also used by archeologists.\r\n\r\nScientific scanner. These scanners provide information about energy, substances, and life-forms, but cannot be used to diagnose illnesses. Scientific scanners can use a variety of scientific skills.\r\n\r\nTactical scanner. These scanners only provide information on the number, type, and location of nearby life-forms. They are used for tactical purposes. They are more robust than other scanners. Tactical scanners use the tactics skill (which additionally means that high quality tactical scanners can add to INITIATIVE rolls).\r\n\r\nQuestions asked while using a scanner must be specific closed questions which the GM can answer in a single, short sentence. More detailed information is obtained or narrowed down by asking a series of questions. Any question within the remit of a scanner is allowed, as long as it is specific and can be answered with a single, short sentence. A typical scan sequence may look like this:\r\n\r\n1. Presence of energy sources, life-forms, or substances within range.\r\n\r\n2. Direction and approximate distance.\r\n\r\n3. Type or composition.\r\n\r\n4. More precise data.\r\n\r\nImpediments. There are various impediments to scanning attempts. Things like thick stone, shields, or severe atmospheric conditions, can each impose the standard -1d6 penalty to the attempt (as do range increments).\r\n\r\nLonger range scans. A normal scan takes one round. A longer range scan can be attempted. This takes one minute, and allows the user to multiply the range increment by 10. However, the amount of detail available becomes less granular; questions asked can only be answered with “yes” or “no”.\r\n\r\nScanning creatures. When receiving information about a creature, the answer to a question may be relayed in game mechanics rather than natural English. This is a convenient way to communicate complex data and biological information to a player. It is therefore perfectly reasonable to ask “What is the reptile’s STRENGTH attribute?” and get the answer “14”, or “How much damage does its acid blood do?” and be told “2d6”. The actual data on the scanning device is far more complicated, but this is a useful abstraction.",

They make excellent farmers and shopkeepers.\r\n\r\nSmallfolk favor simple clothes in bright colors. They tend towards the stout (though not nearly so much as Dwarves), and live to over 100 years of age. They boast pointed ears, although not as pronounced as those of the Elves, and frequently hidden by their curly hair.\r\n\r\nJovial in nature, it can be hard to make a Smallfolk take offense. Smallfolk will put a positive spin on almost anything, a trait which endears them to many. They are as generous as they are jovial, and always happy to welcome others to their homes: indeed, entertaining others is a prime instinct for the Smallfolk.\r\n\r\nMany view the Smallfolk as weak, sometimes even cowardly. While it is true that the race does not tend towards violence, a cornered Smallfolk will defend his or her friends to the death. In truth, Smallfolk are the most courageous of all races.\r\n\r\n## Statistics\r\n\r\nSize/Type: Small humanoid\r\n\r\nAttributes: AGI +2, CHA +2, LUC +2, MAG +1.\r\n\r\nSkill Choices: [crafting], appraisal, bluffing, brewing, cooking, diplomacy, farming, fishing, slings, stealth, thievery\r\n\r\n## Exploits\r\n\r\n- Enchantment Resistant.

          "Markdown": "# Space\r\n\r\nGalaxies vary in size and shape. Each is a gigantic collection of billions of stars, usually orbiting a central body such as a supermassive black hole. There are billions upon billions of galaxies in the universe. The Greeks called our galaxy “galaxias”, which means “milky one” because of the light band across the sky; from these terms we now call our “galaxy” the “Milky Way”. That galaxy is about 100,000 light years (30,000 parsecs) in diameter, with a supermasive black hole called Sagittarius A at its center.\r\n\r\nOf course, your setting doesn’t have to be the Milky Way galaxy. It doesn’t even have to be our universe; however, our own neighborhood is used as an example throughout this section.\r\n\r\nGalaxies are gravitationally bound into groups. The Milky Way is part of a 10 megalightyear diameter group of 50+ galaxies, known as the Local Group. The Milky Way and Andromeda are the two largest galaxies in the group and are also headed for collision several billion years in the future. The Triangulum Galaxy is the next largest. Andromeda is about 780,000 parsecs away, while the Large Magellanic Cloud – one of the Milky Way’s orbiting dwarf galaxies - is about 50,000 parsecs distant.\r\n\r\nTravel between galaxies is a very different scale of achievement to that between stars. Even at speeds which make crossing a galaxy a feasible endeavour, reaching another galaxy requires speeds an order of magnitude higher, absent some kind of shortcut. As a point of reference, the distance to Andromeda is roughly 25 times the diameter of the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nGalactic groups such as the Local Group of galaxies are found in superclusters; the Local Group is part of the Virgo Supercluster of at least 100 similar groups, which in turn is merely an appendage of the Laniakea Supercluster, a structure 500 million light years (153 million parsecs) across and containing some 100,000 galaxies.\r\n\r\n## Distance\r\n\r\nInterstellar distances are typically measured in parsecs.

          "Markdown": "# Random Space Phenomena\r\n\r\nWhenever you need some kind of random space-based objects, choose or roll d66 twice on the table above, which contains many of the objects described earlier, along with a number of exciting new fictional ones.\r\n\r\nThis table is also used for space travel random events when a sensors check is failed.\r\n\r\nThe following phenomena can be added to create a exciting and dynamic starship combat environment or to populate a star system with different features.\r\n\r\nThese descriptions assume that you are portraying them on a starscape using a tactical hex grid. For theater of the mind style encounters, simply ignore hex-based references and narrate the environment.\r\n\r\n11-12) Asteroids. Asteroids take up between one and three hexes. They should be sprinkled liberally across the starscape. Asteroids block line of sight.\r\n\r\n13-14) Black hole. A black hole is not placed on a starscape itself; rather it exists off of one edge of the starscape. Each round, all ships are dragged 1d6 hexes towards that hex edge in a straight line. Any vessel which crosses the edge of the starscape has passed through the event horizon and is effectively destroyed unless it can escape by using an FTL drive.\r\n\r\n15-16) Energy barrier. An energy barrier forms an impassable “sheet” one hex thick which causes 3d6 heat damage to any ship which comes into contact with it.\r\n\r\n21-22) Energy fluctuations. Energy fluctuations are an environmental feature. Each round, roll 1d6; on a roll of 5 or 6, an energy fluctuation takes place. Roll 1d6 on the following table to determine its effect:\r\n\r\n1d6\tEnergy fluctuations\r\n\r\n1 \t\tAll shields are overloaded and go down for this round.\r\n\r\n2 \t\tAll energy weapons deal double damage for this round.\r\n\r\n3 \t\tAll ships take 1d6 heat damage.\r\n\r\n4 \t\tAll sensors are knocked offline, making firing impossible this round.\r\n\r\n5 \t\tCharacters aboard a ship all take 1d6 heat damage.\r\n\r\n6 \t\tEnergy reactions are amplified; ships all double their velocity this round.\r\n\r\n23-24) Funnel clouds. Funnel clouds are gaseous entities of 3 hexes diameter. They look like towering pillars of turbulent gas. A ship can hide within a funnel cloud, rendering it effectively cloaked. However, the ship will take 1d6 heat damage each round while inside the cloud.\r\n\r\n25-26) Gravitational anomaly. Gravitational anomalies have unpredictable effects on starship. An anomaly is 1d6 hexes in diameter. The GM should determine its location, but it is a Difficult [16] INT check to use sensors to locate and chart an anomaly. Any ship which comes into contact with a gravitation anomaly is thrown 3d6 hexes in a randomly determined direction.\r\n\r\n31-32) Magnetar. A magnetar is a type of neutron star with a powerful magnetic field, about the size of a large asteroid (one hex). They inflict a -2d6 penalty to all sensor checks and attack rolls. Magnetars also cause energy fluctuations (see above) with strong x-ray and gamma ray bursts.\r\n\r\n33-34) Dense nebula. Nebulae encompass an entire starscape and reduce sensor and attack range to 2d6 hexes.\r\n\r\n35-36) Plasma storms. Plasma storms are dangerous, explosive phenomena which can cause damage to vessels which stray too close. Storms appear randomly, and disappear again just as quickly. At the start of the encounter, place 1d6 plasma storms of 3-hexes in diameter on the starscape. Each storm has a countdown die of one die; roll 1d6 for each storm each round, and remove it if a 6 is rolled. Additionally, roll 1d6 each round and on a roll of 5-6 add a new plasma storm to the starscape in a randomly determined location. Plasma storms cause 6d6 damage to any starship which comes into contact with it.\r\n\r\n41-42) Psychic penomena. Psychic phenomena affect crew rather than ships, adjusting their emotions. Each round, each character is subjected to a 4d6 vs. MENTAL DEFENSE attack. If the attack is successful, they suffer 2d6 psychic damage.\r\n\r\n43-44) Quantum singularity. A quantum singularity is a type of tiny black hole. It has a massive gravitational pull, but its event horizon is only one-hex in size, and is placed randomly on the starscape. Each round, all ships are dragged 1d6 hexes towards that hex in a straight line. Any vessel which enters the hex has passed through the event horizon and is effectively destroyed.\r\n\r\n45-46) Radiation. Radiation pervades a starscape. Any ship without appropriate shielding is vulnerable to radiation, which harms the crew, causing 1d6 casualties each round.\r\n\r\n51-52) Solar wind. A solar wind is a stream of plasma emanating from a star; solar winds are what solar sails use for propulsion. Technically every star emits a solar wind, which is usually harmless to starships, but occasionally a stellar body will emit such a ferocious solar wind that even starships are in danger. Solar wind moves across the starscape from one edge to another. Starships are pushed one hex in that direction each turn (those with solar sails are pushed 1d6 hexes). In addition, they take 1d6 heat damage from the direction of the solar wind.\r\n\r\n53-54) Space creature. Space creatures are placed randomly on the starscape. A space creature is unpredictable. Roll 1d6 on the following table for its action each turn. A space creature has 4d6 INITIATIVE, 4d6 HEALTH and 3d6 DEFENSE, should any vessel wish to attack it.\r\n\r\n1d6\tSpace Creature Actions\r\n\r\n1 \t\tNo action.\r\n\r\n2 \t\tMove 2d6 hexes in a random direction.\r\n\r\n3 \t\tMove in a straight line towards the nearest vessel.\r\n\r\n4 \t\tAttack the nearest vessel with a ranged attack (4d6 to hit, 4d6 damage).\r\n\r\n5 \t\tEmit an energy surge (see Energy Fluctuations above).\r\n\r\n6 \t\tFlee towards the nearest map edge.\r\n\r\n55-56) Spatial anomaly. A spatial anomaly randomly teleports any vessel which enters it to a random location on the starscape. Spatial anomalies are 3 hexes in diameter and are placed randomly on the starscape.\r\n\r\n61-62) Temporal anomaly. A temporal anomaly can speed up, slow down, or stop time for any that come into contact with it. Temporal anomalies are 1d6 hexes in diameter. If a vessel touches a temporal anomaly, roll 1d6. On a 1-3 the vessel misses its next turn; on a 5-6 the vessel gains an immediate bonus turn.\r\n\r\n63-64) Volatile gas pockets. Volatile gas pockets are hard to detect, but they can be charted with a Difficult [16] INT check. A gas pocket is usually 3 hexes in diameter, and 2d6 of them should be placed randomly on the starscape. Any ship within a volatile gas pocket when it fires a weapon, or when it is hit by a weapon, takes 2d6 heat damage from exploding gas. The gas pocket disappears after exploding.\r\n\r\n65) Wormhole. A wormhole is a one way portal to another location. Any ship entering the wormhole leaves the encounter immediately. Wormholes are usually only 1 hex in diameter, and tend to be very visible.\r\n\r\n66) Astroengineering. Choose one item from the [Astroengineering section](/space/stellar-objects/astroengineering). Roll another d6; on a 6, the structure is operational and current; otherwise it is ancient and abandoned.",

Alternatively, any subject-specific skill can be used instead, depending on what the sensors are being used to scan. *Medicine* can be used when scanning for life-forms, for example, or various planetary sciences when examining a planet from afar.\r\n\r\nWhen making a sensors check, the operator simply makes a *Challenging [13]*LOG check (or, against a vessel, the taregt's DEFENSE score) and asks a question. The question must be specific, but there is no predetermined list of available questions (there are some examples below). In combat, sensor usage is one action and allows one question to be asked. The difficulty of this check is the target ship's DEFENSE score.\r\n\r\n## Sensor Range\r\n\r\nA ship's sensor range increment is noted on its stat-block.  Three scales are used, all using that value. Sensors suffer a -1d6 penalty at every increment beyond the first. The same information is available at each scale, but the time it takes to scan increases.\r\n\r\n    - **Tactical**scans are measured in kilometers (hexes) and takes 1 action\r\n    - **Navigational** scans are measured in AU and take 1 minute.\r\n    - **Long-range** scans are measured in light years and take 1 hour.\r\n\r\nMapping out a star system – stars, planets, asteroid belts, and so on – does not require a check. Stars, similarly, do not require a check. Stars – and their type – can be detected from any distance, as can other similarly large stellar bodies.  Uncloaked ships are automatically detected at tactical range, although blocking line of sight (with an asteroid or planet, for example) forces a check. At navigational range, all ships need a check to detect.\r\n\r\nThe sensor operator must state which type of scan is being undertaken in advance.\r\n\r\n**Detecting vessels.**This requires a check vs the ship's DEFENSE score at navigational range. At tactical range, this is automatic absent other factors.\r\n\r\n**Cloaked ships.**This applies a -3d6 penalty to the detection check, and requires a specific scan in a specified arc. This is required at tactical range.\r\n\r\n## Example Sensor Questions\r\n\r\n- What level of civilisation is on the third planet?\r\n- Which shields does it have raised?\r\n- Is the atmosphere of that moon breathable?\r\n- How many life-forms are on board?\r\n- What's the composition of the asteroid?\r\n- What's the ship's maximum FTL speed?\r\n- Is there any damage to the superstructure?\r\n- What weapons does the vessel have?",

          "Markdown": "# Attribute Checks\r\n\r\nA space journey requires a group attribute check. Three primary checks must be made when making a space journey.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of the checks is decided by the GM, but typically these checks are Routine [10] checks in friendly space, Challenging [15] checks in hostile or unexplored space, and Difficult [20] checks in dangerous space. They can be made by PCs, or by the ship's crew using the vessel's crew rating (typically a 4d6 dice pool).\r\n\r\nThe check suffers a -1d6 penalty for each travel increment.\r\n\r\nComplications can be applied to these checks, as normal. Each complication reduces the dice pool by -1d6.\r\n\r\nEngineer. A LOG check (bolstered by the engineering skill) must be made to maintain the FTL systems. A failed engineering check causes 1d6 damage to the vessel, although it cannot reduce it below half SS.\r\n\r\nNavigator. A LOG check (bolstered by the astrogation skill) must be made to plot the course and calculate FTL coordinates. A failed navigation check means that the fuel cost of the journey is doubled. A good navigator will plot a more efficient course, perhaps effectively completing a spice run in less than the number of parsecs expected.\r\n\r\nSensors. An INT check (bolstered by the computers skill) must be made to use sensors and keep an eye out for hazards. A failed sensors check means an unexpected encounter takes place. This can be with an interstellar phenomenon or with another ship. The GM should roll for or select an encounter from the Space Phenomenatable in the core rulebooks.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, some secondary checks may be required under certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nMedic. On a journey of more than one week, a LOG check (bolstered by the medicineskill) is required to monitor the crew, their physical and mental health, and their diets. A failed medical check means that 1d6 crew members are lost to illness or injury. If a 6 is rolled on this die, an infectious illness breaks out.\r\n\r\nSecurity. On a ship of more than 50 crew, an INT check must be made to maintain order and spot trouble on board the ship. A failed security check can cause sloppiness, and even petty crime. This costs the ship 1d6cr x the crew complement.\r\n\r\nSpace travel is a “fail forward” system – the ship will not fail to navigate to its destination, but the checks determine the condition it arrives in. Add up all the successful checks and all the unsuccessful checks. If there are more unsuccessful checks than successful checks, when the ship arrives at its destination PCs are Fatigued, and the crew is considered one category less skilled (elite - experienced - standard - poor) until they have had 24 hours' rest for each range increment travelled.",

          "Markdown": "# Starship Combat\r\n\r\nStarship combat is similar to ground combat. Attacks are made using dice pools based on attributes and skills, and ships move in an attempt to gain advantageous positions from which to fire upon their enemies.  The action economy is slightly different, however. Instead of two actions per turn like in a ground-based encounter, a starship has one movement action and a number of other actions equal to its class. These actions can be performed by PCs or by the [ship's crew](https://sites.google.com/site/woinrrd/space/starship-combat#h.p_ejsDlkV68w-O).\r\n\r\nDistances in starship encounter are measured in kilometers.  If a hex grid is used, one hex equals 1km.\r\n\r\n## Play Sequence\r\n\r\nThe play sequence is similar to that of a regular ground-based encounter.\r\n\r\n- 1. Make attribute checks to access the ambush turn, if appropriate. These will be opposed by ship sensors.\r\n    2. Roll INITIATIVE for each PC and each ship based on its [crew dice pool](https://sites.google.com/site/woinrrd/space/starship-combat#h.p_ejsDlkV68w-O).  Larger ships inflict INITIATIVE penalties, noted in their stat blocks. For GM-controlled ships, simply roll once for the ship.\r\n    3. Each PC (and GM-controlled ship) takes a turn in INITIATIVE order, starting with whichever rolled the highest. Ships move on their own INITIATIVE.\r\n    4. At the end of the round, move on to the next round and repeat, re-rolling INITIATIVE every round.\r\n\r\n## Basic Movement\r\n\r\nA vessel has a current speed, and it may increase or decrease that speed at the start of its turn by an amount equal to its SPEED score.\r\n\r\nA vessel must move a number of hexes equal to its current speed. It may also turn one hex side for free at any point during that movement.\r\n\r\nAlso, see [Newtonian Movement](/starship-combat/advanced-starship-combat) for more advanced ship movement rules.\r\n\r\n## Actions\r\n\r\nIn addition to movement, each ship takes a number of actions in its turn. The number of actions available to it is equal to the ship's class - a Class V vessel will move and take 5 actions. Player-crewed ships get one action per PC or one action per class, whichever is higher. All PCs get to take an action. If the ship class is higher than the number of PCs, [the crew](https://sites.google.com/site/woinrrd/space/starship-combat#h.p_ejsDlkV68w-O) takes the remaining actions. Actions consist of attacks, special exploits, repairs, scans, and more. A large vessel can accomplish a lot of simultaneous actions in one turn, although large ships tend to have low INITIATIVE and act last.\r\n\r\nNote that PC controlled ships (not GM controlled ships) have a minimum number of actions equal to the number of PCs. All PCs get to take an action.\r\n\r\nActions are performed just like they are in ground-based encounters. Attribute checks, bolstered by skills, are made to attack, scan, and so on. Attacks are made using attributes vs. the target's DEFENSE, just like on the ground. Scans with starship sensors work just like scans with handheld scanners, albeit with range increments measured in kilometers rather than feet – roll a check vs the target's DEFENSE and ask a question.\r\n\r\nEvery ship has a [crew rating](https://sites.google.com/site/woinrrd/space/starship-combat#h.p_ejsDlkV68w-O) which indicates the dice pool the crew makes when performing an action, whether that be an attack, a repair, or something else. The crew uses this set dice pool for all actions. A typical (standard) crew rolls 4d6.\r\n\r\nJust like in ground combat, there is no fixed list of available actions. A character can do anything; the GM will assign the appropriate attribute check if necessary. However, the following list provides some examples.\r\n\r\n- Attack with a shipboard weapon using a LOG or INT vs. a target's DEFENSE. The gunnery skill helps with this.\r\n- Repair 2 points of SS or 1d6 CPU cycles with a Difficult [16] LOG check. Engineering helps with SS, while computers helps with CPU cycles. SS repaired during combat is temporary emergency repairs and only lasts one day. Permanent repairs require one hour per SS for each point above 50% normal, and one day per SS for each point below 50% and cost 0.5 MCr per point.\r\n- Scan a target by making a LOG check vs. the target's DEFENSE and ask a single question about that target. You can use the computers skill to use ship sensors, or specific skills if they information you seek is related to a specific subject (engineering if you're scanning their engines, medicine if you're looking for life-forms, and so on).\r\n- Perform medical actions to either heal a PC, or restore a crewmember to duty. The ship's sick bay tells you its capacity per day for restoring casualties to duty. The medicine skill is useful here. This is a Challenging [13] LOG check. A failed check to restore a crewmember to duty means that the casualty becomes permanent. Permanent losses must be replaced at an appropriate location.\r\n- Make an electronic attack using LOG vs. the target's E-DEFENSE. Success causes 1d6 damage to the target's current CPU cycles, possibly causing systems to shut down.\r\n- Jam a target ship’s communications. Make an electronic attack vs. the target’s e- DEFENSE. If you are successful, the target ship’s comms are jammed until the start of your next turn.\r\n- Act as a spotter, calling out targets to gunners. The spotter makes INT (perception) checks vs. the target’s DEFENSE, and if successful all allies aboard the ship gain +1d6 to hit that target until the beginning of the spotter’s next turn.\r\n- There are four shield arcs (forward, port, starboard, aft). A PC can divert power from any given shield to another, but cannot more than double the total power to a given shield. Shield realignment, like other onboard systems, can only be done once per turn.\r\n- Launch a shuttle or a fighter squadron.\r\n- Perform an exploit.\r\n- Use transporters, tractor beams, or other special equipment.\r\n\r\n## Firing Weapons\r\n\r\nA character fires a shipboard weapon using his LOGIC for missiles and torpedoes (it's a complex, mathematical process plotting trajectories) or INTUITION for energy and ballistic weapons vs. the target ship's DEFENSE. The gunnery skill applies to ship weaponry. The target ship must be in the weapon's arc of fire; there are four arcs marked forward, aft, port, and starboard; some weapons are mounted in turrets, which give it access to more than one firing arc.\r\n\r\nIf a weapon hits, roll the damage noted on its stat-block entry. If the ship has a SOAK value from shields or armor, deduct that amount. The final total is applied to the target's SUPERSTRUCTURE.\r\n\r\nBanks. Some weapons are mounted in banks or arrays. These are noted in the stat block. Banks and arrays require just one attack roll to hit with multiple weapons, and can be operated simultaneously by a single gunner.\r\n\r\nMissiles. Missile weapons often have long ranges and high damage potential compared to energy weapons. However, they are more easily defended against with point defenses, and take two rounds to reach their target beyond 10 hexes (if you are using miniatures, they move at 10 hexes per round). If the target moves outside the missile's range in that time, the missile will fail to engage.\r\n\r\nEnergy weapons. Lasers, phasers, ion weapons, blasters, disruptors, and other energy weapons lose 1d6 damage per range increment.\r\n\r\nIon weapons. When determining ion damage to a ship, divide the total by two. Half of the damage is applied to the ship's SS, and half is applied to its CPU capacity.\r\n\r\nThe following modifiers apply to attacks.\r\n\r\n- - Stationary target +1d6\r\n    - Rear attack +1d6\r\n    - Forward-mounted weapons +1d6\r\n    - Per range increment -1d6\r\n    - Aft-mounted weapons -1d6\r\n\r\n## Shields\r\n\r\nShields reduce incoming damage by an amount equal to their SOAK score. Each time a shield is penetrated, its SOAK value is reduced by 1 point. A character can repair one point of shield SOAK with a Difficult [16] LOG check.\r\n\r\n## Casualties\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, ship damage merely reduces the vessel's SUPERSTRUCTURE until it reaches 0. However, whenever the ship takes 5 or more damage (after the SOAK from shields and armor have been deducted), casualties may occur.\r\n\r\nEach player-character should roll 1d6. On a roll of 6, the character takes 2d6 damage.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, any crew beyond the player-characters take 1d6 casualties.\r\n\r\nA ship below its minimum crew complement suffers -1d6 to all actions. A ship below half its minimum crew complement suffers -2d6. A ship below one-tenth of its crew complement cannot function.\r\n\r\n## Point Defenses\r\n\r\nPoint defenses grant an “aura”. Unlike shields, which provide a passive defense, point defenses are an active measure. Point defenses are usually too weak to do serious damage to a large vessel, but can cut swathes through squadrons of fighters or smaller ships which get too close.\r\n\r\nAn aura is assigned a range. Vessels within the aura's range automatically take 1d6 damage. The damage is inflicted whenever a ship enters the aura or begins its turn in the aura.\r\n\r\nPoint defenses also grant a continuous DEFENSE bonus vs. missiles and fighters.\r\n\r\n## Fighters\r\n\r\nLaunching a fighter squadron takes one action. A squadron has these statistics:\r\n\r\nSPEED 10, 1 action, attack rolls and INITITIATVE equal to the host ship's crew, HEALTH equal to the number of fighters, attack range increment 3.\r\n\r\nDamage is 1d6 (to a maximum equal to the number of fighters) to other squadrons, or a flat amount equal to the number of fighters to other targets.\r\n\r\nSquadrons take 1d6 casualties when entering or beginning their turn within a point defense aura. All other weapons do 1 damage to a squadron, regardless of the weapon's damage value.\r\n\r\n## Electronic Warfare\r\n\r\nMake a LOG vs. E-DEFENSE attack. A hit does 1d6 CPU damage. When CPU reaches zero, the computer shuts down and the ship goes offline.\r\n\r\nCPU is restored with a Difficult [16] LOG check, which recovers 1d6 CPU points.\r\n\r\nCPU can be reduced below zero, making it take longer to bring systems back online.\r\n\r\n## Exploding Ships\r\n\r\nA ship reduced to 0 SUPERSTRUCTURE starts to roll a fast countdown from a pool equal to its class, after which it explodes, killing everybody on board. The time taken by the countdown period can be used to evacuate the ship. The explosion can also cause damage to those nearby. The damage is equal to the ship's total power (all engines), reduced by 50% for each hex (each kilometer) of distance from the explosion.\r\n\r\n## Collisions\r\n\r\nCollisions (either through accident or deliberate ramming) do damage to both parties. The damage each vessel or object inflicts on the other is equal to its class multiplied by its velocity. Stellar objects, such as asteroids, have classes just like starships do. Asteroids range from Class I all the way up to Class 30, and typically have a velocity of 1d6.\r\n\r\n## Escaping To FTL\r\n\r\nAdd the following: “FTL drives have a “spool time” - the time it takes to engage FTL. This is equal to the ship’s class in rounds. During that time, the ship must remain on a straight vector (or remain stationary) and cannot turn or alter its velocity.”\r\n\r\n## Crews\r\n\r\nA ship's crew has a dice pool based on its rating:\r\n\r\n- Poor crews roll 3d6\r\n- Standard crews roll 4d6\r\n- Experienced crews roll 5d6\r\n- Veteran crews roll 6d6\r\n- Elite crews roll 7d6\r\n\r\nCrews can take actions when the ship has actions available and all PCs have taken actions. Fighter squadrons use the host ship's crew rating.",

There are hex-based star maps available to help plan space travel. Breaking a longer journey up into sections can make progress easier.\r\n\r\n## FTL Speeds\r\n\r\nSpace travel times are shown in the table below. C refers to a multiple of the speed of light – the actual speed of a ship is the cube of its FTL factor (thus FTL-5 is 125 times light speed). A parsec is 3.26 light years. FTL-7 is very close to 1 day per light year; when local variations and other factors are taken into account, 1 day per light year is accurate enough for navigational use. This has made it the standard travel speed, and is referred to as “standard speed”, as in “set a course for Sirius X at standard speed”. FTL-20 is almost exactly 1 light year per hour.\r\n\r\nThe Milky Way is roughly 100,000 light years in diameter. Even at FTL-20 (8,000 times light speed) it would take 11 years to cross the entire galaxy. At FTL-100 (1-million times light speed) it would take roughly 40 days.\r\n\r\nRange. A starship has a travel increment measured in days equal to its class, multiplied by its LUXURY percentage. Additionally, crew quality affects it as follows: poor 80%, experienced 150%, elite 200%. For every increment beyond the first, attribute checks suffer a -1d6 penalty. A Class VII ship can make a journey of 7 days with no penalty, but a journey of 10 days inflicts a -1d6 penalty, and a journey of 15 days causes a -2d6 penalty.  This count is reset when a ship docks at a space station, or enters orbit around a planet and allows the crew a day to rest.\r\n\r\n[Try the FTL Travel Calculator](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.enworld.org%2Ftools%2Fftl.php&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw1qJiwkbA9bznDd7Cj0eR6b)\r\n\r\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/a7lWKysW08LMK3wK992J8cFN3SqmsAuVmEVhEHDnIjNAWEwKq3TgDO5-XldtpwAsY0HY4fGmIO0AqYRx_CkQEPzr-hb4Ho1HO_0TeRaKY8Wdyio95Am2tfMe37pijIyf=w1280)\r\n\r\n## Different Assumptions\r\n\r\nIn some settings, FTL travel occurs at vastly greater speeds than in others. Where one setting may have a Federation covering 20% of the Milky Way, another might have a Galactic Empire spanning an entire galaxy. In the former, it might takes days to traverse just one sector, while in the latter the entire galaxy might be crossed in the same time or less.\r\n\r\nThe former speeds are typically Advancement Level 9 technology, and the latter are Advancement Level 10 technology.\r\n\r\nThese two technology levels create different types of game setting. The slower assumption allows for more exploratory games, while the latter makes space travel a trivial aspect. A galaxy in an AL10 setting is likely fully explored, or nearly so.\r\n\r\nFor such speeds, FTL-X is a more cumbersome way to refer to travel velocity. Instead, some settings (such as the aforementioned Galactic Empire setting) use a simpler rating system where a Class 1 FTL drive is twice the speed of a Class 2 FTL drive, which is itself twice the speed of a Class 4 FTL drive. Conversely, a Class 0.5 drive (one which can, colloquially speaking, make “0.5 past light speed”) is twice the speed of a Class 1 drive.\r\n\r\nThe math conveniently works out to 1 parsec in 1 minute per FTL rating class.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3y_Ka8qQ1_zZtbNInny_1b_BoP-zLAxmtMTcnxwna1KSooSLfpguJ9nq1VTz3xTEtipyVlk5VVnODnhfqtNQ4gn5LP4JMB8K0ju_Laq52THwZYE-jsKhAcaP8hSixtBXng=w1280)",

          "Markdown": "# Inner-System Travel\r\n\r\nCompared to interstellar travel, movement within a solar system consists of extremely short journeys – relatively speaking. However, if these are not undertaken at faster-than light speeds, the journeys can still take a very long time. In 2006, the NASA space probe New Horizons left Earth, reaching the dwarf planet Pluto nine years later.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/e90baBAdf9YvY7eP_sXfTOdAxxvNDbZeWi8R3eq16zznsNvID3XLgB93tHfQS9L2Ylp2lwBV1isTN4vfcWW-qN5C6cxZhi_fW1YuQ5ShaWwd-9Q9yy1OvxUOOWQmRClRuw=w1280)\r\n\r\n[Try the Sublight Travel Calculator](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.enworld.org%2Ftools%2Fsubl.php&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw2W_kYHgsaFc_DHca2m0u3F)\r\n\r\n## Distance\r\n\r\nDistances within a solar system are measured in Astronomical Units (AU). 1AU is equal to 93 million miles, or the average distance from Earth to its Sun. Pluto orbits at about 40AU on average, meaning that at light speed (FTL-1), it would take 5.5 hours to get there.\r\n\r\nSUB-L 0.1 is roughly 550,000 km/h, and is the approximate speed of a high speed early 21st century space vessel.\r\n\r\nSUB-L 7 is 1 hour per AU.\r\n\r\nSUB-L 20 is equal to FTL-1, the speed of light. Under normal physics, a ship cannot ever reach SUB-L 20; the laws of relativity forbid an object from reaching light speed without special faster-than-light technology.\r\n\r\nNote that while a starship’s SPEED rating (as shown in its stat block) is used for both tactical combat and in-system travel, the two uses are not directly equivalent. Navigational speed (which uses an exponential scale similar to the way FTL speeds are calculated) is much faster than tactical speed (the number of kilometers a ship moves in one round; see Starship Combat, later) despite the fact that both are based on the same basic SPEED rating.\r\n\r\nA SUB-L journey is resolved in exactly the same way as an FTL journey. The only difference is the units used.\r\n\r\n## Time Dilation\r\n\r\nThe final column on the Sublight travel time table shows the effect of time dilation on sublight speeds as they approach that of light.\r\n\r\nFTL speeds do not suffer from issues of time dilation. However, those travelling at high sublight speeds will find that time passes more slowly for them than for those not moving. For every day (or hour, or any other unit of time) spent travelling, multiply it by the Dilation column to determine how much time passes for those at rest.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen from the table, the effect rises sharply as lightspeed is approached, with most of the increase being found in the small range consisting of 0.99 lightspeed and above. However, the effect is still noticeable at lower velocities, especially at 0.5 lightspeed and above.\r\n\r\nThe dilation rises ever more steeply in the increasingly tiny range between the ship’s speed and the speed of light. Whileno appreciable journey time saving is made beyond SUB-L 19.9 for a journey of 1 parsec, at 0.999999c two years passes for those at rest for every day spent travelling; and at 0.99999999999999c, twenty thousand years passes for each day.\r\n\r\nSublight speeds beyond SUB-L 19 are not typically used, for obvious reasons.",

          "Markdown": "# Types of FTL Travel\r\n\r\nThe speed of light in a vacuum is 186,282 miles per second. Faster-than-light travel, properly referred to as superluminal travel, is a process by which the laws of special relativity which normally forbid such speeds are broken or circumvented. Technically, the laws aren’t broken – but certain solutions to the equations allow FTL travel in specified ways or “effectively” travel faster than light without actually doing so. Some special particles such as tachyons travel faster than light at all times. The types of FTL travel available may be dependent on the game setting or, in settings where multiple types of FTL travel exist, on location, species, or advancement level.\r\n\r\nUnlike subluminal speeds at a large fraction of light speed, moving faster than light also avoids relativistic effects; the time experienced by the traveler is the same as that experienced by the observer, unless otherwise noted.\r\n\r\nThe 20th century physicist Geoffrey Landis of the NASA Lewis Research Center categorized FTL systems as follows:\r\n\r\n## REALDRIVE/JUMP GATES |Type 0\r\n\r\nA drive which uses tricks of spacetime geometry (a la general relativity) to travel faster than light.\r\n\r\nJump gates are also known by a variety of names – stargates, wormholes, boomtubes, mass relays, hypergates, transwarp conduits, quantum gates, portals, and space bridges. A jump gate links two points of space-time so that a vessel can travel quickly between them by traveling through hyperspace. Naturally occurring jump gates are usually known as wormholes.\r\n\r\n## HYPERDRIVE |Type I\r\n\r\nThe ships enters some different space during the trip, whether or not time passes for the crew while in this space.\r\n\r\nHyperdrive relies on the concept of an alternate space where dimensions, distance, and time work differently. A vessel slips into this alternate space (named variously as hyperspace, null space, N-space, subspace, space2, phase space, nodespace, slipspace, irrational space, zero space, otherspace, and more), travels to its destination, and then slips out again into normal space.\r\n\r\n## ALCUBIERRE/WARP DRIVE |Type II\r\n\r\nA bubble of different space is projected around the ship so that the ship can travel faster-than-light while still in realspace.\r\n\r\nAntimatter engines are used to power warp systems which create a space-time bubble which is able to travel at superluminal speeds. These systems are most commonly known as warp drives, or Alcubierre drives after the 20th century physicist Miguel Alcubierre. The antimatter reactor is used to power the displacement field.\r\n\r\n## JUMP DRIVE |Type III\r\n\r\nThe ship travels from one point to another, possibly in multiple jumps, without occupying the intervening space and without the use of a different space to assist the travel.\r\n\r\nA jump drive enables a vessel to travel instantaneously from one point to another. Rather than travel through hyperspace or accelerate a warp bubble, a jump drive teleports the ship. In most cases, the jump distance is limited, requiring long journeys to use multiple jumps.\r\n\r\n## FAKEDRIVE |Type X\r\n\r\nAssume that special relativity or general relativity are incorrect in part or in whole, or just ignore them. Now you can just accelerate at constant gravity until you go faster than light.",

FTL travel reduces an AU to a trivial distance, as can be seen in the following table.\r\n\r\nAt FTL-10, travel from the Sun to Pluto is a journey of a mere 20 seconds (in comparison, at the same speed, it would take 29 hours to reach the nearest star).\r\n\r\nTravel at these speeds inside a crowded star system is difficult and dangerous, however. Star systems often contain large amounts of clutter – planets, asteroids, comets, and clouds of ice and rock such as Sol’s Oort Cloud, which surrounds the entire system. There’s no physical law preventing it, but the FTL calculations are much more complex than those for interstellar travel.\r\n\r\nIn populated systems, the danger is even greater. Many civilized systems will have local laws determining the permitted speeds or usage of FTL drives.\r\n\r\nFTL \t1 AU\r\n\r\n1 \t\t8 mins\r\n\r\n2 \t\t1 min\r\n\r\n3 \t\t18 secs\r\n\r\n4 \t\t7.5 secs\r\n\r\n5 \t\t3.8 secs\r\n\r\n6 \t\t2.2 secs\r\n\r\n7 \t\t1.4 secs\r\n\r\n8 \t\t0.9 secs\r\n\r\n9 \t\t0.7 secs\r\n\r\n10 \t\t0.5 secs\r\n\r\nWithin a charted star system, the navigator’s FTL checks take a -2d6 penalty. Within an uncharted system, the checks take a -3d6 penalty. And in a crowded, populated system, an additional -1d6 penalty is applied.\r\n\r\nFailure on this check dumps the ship unceremoniously out of FTL as automated systems avoid a collision. This badly damages the FTL engines and the superstructure. The ship takes 2d6 damage to its SS, and the FTL engines go offline until they are repaired, which requires a Difficult [16] minor science.",

          "Markdown": "# Spellcasting Basics\n\nAll magic-users, whether practitioners of divine, natural, or arcane careers, use the same broad, flexible system. Whatever their source or focus of power, they’re all accessing the same magic, albeit in different ways. A user of magic is referred to herein as a magic-user; this refers to any character or creature using magic, whatever career they possess, if any.\n\nMagic-users use Magic Points to cast their spells. Different careers may refer to this reservoir of magical potential as spirit, energy, mana, faith, or any number of other names.\n\n## Magic Attribute\n\nThe Magic attribute determines how many Magic Points (MP) a magic-user has available, and also forms part of the dice pool used when casting a spell. A character’s Magic attribute can be increased in various ways. Spellcasting ability improves incrementally as magic-users improve their Magic attribute, granting access to more powerful spells, knowledge of more diverse spells, and a greater pool of MP to cast spells with. This can also allow a magic-user to study multiple magical careers and still be able to cast powerful spells.\n\nMagic Points. A magic-user’s total MP is equal to three times their Magic attribute (unless a career or ability says otherwise). Most spellcasters have an additional reserve of MP in an implement such as a staff or wand.\n\nMaximum spell MP. A magic-user can spend no more MP on a single spell than the value of her Magic attribute. Thus, a character with a Magic attribute of 5 could spend no more than 5 MP on each spell. In this way, the Magic attribute acts as a cap upon a magic-user’s power.\n\n## Magic Points\n\nMagic points (MP) are the reservoir of power magicusers expend in order to cast spells. When a magic-user runs out of MP she cannot cast any more spells until she rests and regains her MP. The amount of MP that a caster has depends on her Magic attribute (three times her Magic attribute).\n\nDifferent careers may refer to Magic Points in different ways, whether that is mana, faith, energy, power, spirit, juju, mojo, or something else. Players should note their character’s name for Magic Points on their character sheet.\n\nA magic-user recovers MP by resting. Once per day, a magic-user may spend an hour to regain MP. During this hour she might pray, meditate, study notes she has written about her spells, or take any other sort of focused, non-stressful action. A magic-user can only spend time to regain MP if she is relatively well rested— usually this means after 8 hours of sleep. After resting, she fully regains all of her MP.\n\nCasting a spell costs MP. Again, you can pay no more MP for a single spell than your Magic attribute.\n\n## Secrets\n\nThe world is governed by uncountable secrets. Everything has a secret—every element, every material, every creature. Some secrets are broad, and some are more specific; some are common, and others are rare. These secrets can be discovered by magic-users, and hold the key to their use of magic.\n\nThere is no finite list of secrets. However, some common examples include good, evil, life, death, air, fire, earth, water, demons, beasts, fey, plants, shadow, metal, undead, and weather. A secret gives a magic-user the key to a “thing” in the world. Secrets are words of power— the true names of things in the world, whether those things be elements, objects, or creatures.\n\nCharacters learn secrets by selecting the Arcane Secret exploit. The GM should determine which secrets are available; for example, the PCs could embark on a quest to find the secret of dragons. Like skills, secrets operate in a keyword-based manner, and are divided into elements, creatures, and virtues.\n\nVirtues are present only in certain beings who personify or exemplify that virtue; most creatures are free-willed. There is no set limit to the number of secrets—technically, there is a secret of curtains and a secret of shoes—but those below are common secrets.\n\nAn additional secret, self, is automatically known by all creatures. This ensures that a caster can always affect themself, and also serves as an “all” secret for some specific enhancements.\n\nSome of the common secrets listed below are occasionally referred to in different ways.\n\n- **Person**. Person is equivalent to humanoid.\n- **Good & Evil**. Good and evil damage is often referred to as holy and unholy damage.\n- **Life & Death**. Death damage is often referred to as necrotic damage. The life element cannot cause damage.\n\n### Common Secrets\n\n**Special**--Self\n\n**Creatures**--Aquan, Automaton, Aviab, Beast, Demon, Fey, Goblinoid, Insect, Person, Plant, Reptile, Spirit, Undead\n\n**Virtues**--Good, Evil\n\n**Elements**--Acid, Air, Death, Earth, Fire, Ice, Lava, Life, Light, Lightning, Magic, Metal, Mist, Ooze, Shadow, Sound, Space, Void, Water, Wood\n\n## Skills\n\nSkills, such as abjuration, evocation, creation, and divination, are areas of study. While a secret holds the “magic” part of spell, the skill holds the “technical” part—the practice of spellcasting. Non-casters can have ranks in magical skills, representing their knowledge of that subject, but when the skill is combined with a secret a spell is formed.\n\nMagical skills represent areas of arcane expertise in the sense that each applies the power of magic to a different sort of effect.\n\n\n| **Skill**  | **Form** |\n| ---  | --- |\n| **Abjuration**  | Abjure [element], [creature], or [virtue]|\n| **Affliction**  | Inflict [element]|\n| **Compulsion**  | Compel [creature] or [virtue]|\n| **Creation**  | Create [element]|\n| **Displacement** |Displace [element] or [creature]|\n| **Divination**  | See [element], [creature,] or [virtue]|\n| **Enchantment**  | Enchant [creature]|\n| **Evocation**  | Evoke [element]|\n| **Healing/Mending** | Heal/mend [element] or [creature]|\n| **Hexes**    | Hex [creature]|\n| **Illusion**  | Illude\\*|\n| **Infusion**  | Infuse [element] or [virtue]|\n| **Movement**  | Move [creature] or [element]|\n| **Summoning**  | Summon [creature]|\n| **Transformation** |Transform [element] or [creature]\n\n\\* Does not require a secret\n\n## List of Magical Skills\n\nThe following are the default magical skills in the WOIN RPG. Words in parentheses following the skill name indicate the spellcasting verb associated with the skill.\n\n**Abjuration (Abjure)**. Abjuration spells can provide numerous types of defenses. Most abjuration spells defend individual creatures or objects, but you can create a spell that limits the movements of creatures into or out of an area, enhance Defense, grant damage resistance, or restrict the movements of certain creatures. Abjuration also includes the suppression or dispelling of magical effects.\n\n**Affliction (Inflict)**. Affliction spells are the reverse of infusion spells. An affliction spell saps a creature, reducing its attributes or other aspects, or causes diseases. Afflictions inflict END-based conditions on a creature.\n\n**Compulsion (Compel)**. Compulsion spells force creatures to act certain ways. Weaker compulsions let you set a specific task for the character to perform, while more powerful compulsions give you ongoing control of the creature’s actions.\n\n**Creation (Create)**. Creation spells let you make objects or energy out of nothing. You cannot create creatures, and any energy you create is no more damaging than the weakest evocation, but many other effects are possible.\n\n**Displacement (Displace)**. Displacement is the manipulation of time and space. Through its use, time can be sped up, slowed, or even stopped, and different dimensions and planes can be accessed. This includes teleportation, phasing, and dimensional travel.\n\n**Divination (See)**. Divinations allow the magic-user to discover information, view distant locations, to see things normally unseen, and to let her spells reach extreme distances.\n\n**Enchantment (Enchant)**. Enchantment spells alter the moods and emotions of creatures, making them more likely to perform certain actions. Unlike compulsions, enchantments cannot force a character to perform more than the most primitive actions; at best, an enchantment might put a creature to sleep or make it attack in a frenzied anger. Enchantments inflict WIL-based conditions on a creature.\n\n**Evocation (Evoke)**. Evocations are the flashiest, most impressive end of spellcasting, and the most directly applicable to combat. Evocations are what a caster uses to throw fire and lightning, blast her enemies, or wield ice and lightning as weapons.\n\n**Healing/Mending (Heal/Mend)**. Healing spells cure or mend damage and other afflictions to creatures, or to objects with the appropriate element type. Healing spells affecting objects are called mending spells.\n\n**Hexes (Hex)**. A hex is the opposite of an abjuration—instead of providing defense, it instead weakens a target’s defenses.\n\n**Illusion (Illude)**. Illusions are sounds, images, and other sensory deceptions.\n\n**Infusion (Infuse)**. Infusion spells fill creatures with spiritual or elemental energy, enhancing attributes that are related to the chosen element, or making the target detect as the chosen virtue or element.\n\n**Movement (Move)**. Movement spells enhance movement abilities, allowing creatures to swim, burrow, fly, and travel at great speeds. They also enable you to move other objects using telekinesis-like spells.\n\n**Summoning (Summon)**. Summoning spells can bring creatures to you from elsewhere (such as the classic demon summoning), create a creature out of existing material (like turning bones into a skeletal warrior), or can create a creature whole cloth (like making a construct out of ectoplasm).\n\n**Transformation (Transform)**. Transformation spells can physically transmogrify your target into a particular type of creature or into a particular substance you choose.",

          "Markdown": "# Stars\r\n\r\nGalaxies are made up of billions of stars. It is estimated that the Milky Way contains 100-400 billion stars. Stars form the center of star systems, orbited by planets, asteroids, and more. Sol, our sun, is one such star; its closest stellar neighbor is Proxima Centauri, some 4 light years away.\r\n\r\nThe universe is teeming with life, sometimes in the most unlikely places. Of carbon-based human-like advanced life, larger stars (O, B, A) do not typically last long enough for advanced life to develop, while smaller stars (M) tend to tidally lock their planets making them generally uninhabitable. The most probable stars for human-like life have been found to be mainsequence stars between types A and M – most commonly dwarf stars of types F, G, and K.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted, though, that life doesn’t have to develop in a star system to be present. Populations migrate, terraforming and other colonization techniques exist, and outposts and space stations can substitute for planets. Additionally, planets can have enough geothermal heating to make subterranean life that never sees the surface possible. While life around a slow pulsar or similar stellar object might be unusual, life finds a way to thrive anywhere.\r\n\r\n## Spectral Classification\r\n\r\nStars are classified based on their temperature. The classification system, originally devised in the 20th Century by Morgan and Keenan uses a system of letters and numbers. The letters indicate a broad spectral classification, with numbers subdividing them further.\r\n\r\nType\t\t\t\t\tDescription\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExamples\r\n\r\nO (blue)\t\t\t\tHot, extremely luminous\t\t\t\t\t\tTau Canis Majoris, Lambda Cephel\r\n\r\nB (blue-white)\t\tLuminous\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRigel, Bellatrix, Spica\r\n\r\nA (white)\t\t\t\tCommon\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSirius, Deneb, Altair, Fomalhaut\r\n\r\nF (yellow-white)\t\tCommon\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlkrakis, Canopus, Polaris\r\n\r\nG (yellow)\t\t\t\tCommon\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSol, Alpha Centauri A, Tau Ceti\r\n\r\nK (orange)\t\t\t\tCommon\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAloha Centauri B, Epsilon Eridani, Artcurus, Aldeberan\r\n\r\nM (red)\t\t\t\tMost common; red dwarfs and red giants\tBetelgeuse, Antares, Prixima Centauri, Barnard's Star\r\n\r\n## Luminosity Class\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a luminosity class is represented by Roman numerals. Sol, for example, is a G2V star – a yellow main sequence star with a temperature of about 5,800K.\r\n\r\nLuminosity\t\tDescription\r\n\r\nI\t\t\t\tSupergiant\r\n\r\nII\t\t\t\tBright giant\r\n\r\nIII\t\t\t\tGiant\r\n\r\nIV\t\t\t\tSub-giant\r\n\r\nV\t\t\t\tMain-sequence or Dwarf\r\n\r\nVI\t\t\t\tSub-dwarf\r\n\r\n## Unusual Stars\r\n\r\nThere are some additional stellar classifications which do not fit into the standard system of classification.\r\n\r\nType \tDescription \t\t\t\t\t\t\tExamples\r\n\r\nW \t\tDying supergiants \t\t\t\t\tGamms Velorum A\r\n\r\nL \t\tRed dwarfs, faint; some supergiants V838 Monocerotis\r\n\r\nT \t\tMethane dwarfs; cool brown \t\tEpsilon Indi Ba\r\n\r\nY \t\tUltra-cool brown dwarfs \t\t\tWISE 0410+1502\r\n\r\nC \t\tCarbon stars; ancient red giants \tR Cmi, R Leporis\r\n\r\nS \t\tGiants and supergiants \t\t\t\tS Ursae Majoris\r\n\r\nD \t\tWhite dwarfs (“degenerate”)\t\tSirius B, Van Maanen’s Star\r\n\r\n## Neutron Stars\r\n\r\nAfter a massive supernova, the remnants can form a neutron star. Very hot and very small (about the size of a town), neutron stars have such a high density that a teaspoon of matter can weigh as much as a 21st century aircraft carrier. Neutron stars tend to spin very fast, and have an escape velocity of about one-third the speed of light. Some neutron stars which direct radio waves, X rays, or gamma radiation at regular intervals are known as pulsars, while those with immensely strong magnetic fields are called magnetars. Different pulsars have different pulse intervals, ranging from milliseconds up to several seconds.\r\n\r\nA star system - including the surfaces of planets - around a neutron star is highly radioactive, with high energy cosmic rays which can seriously harm living creatures and cause radiation sickness, although some protection can be found below the planet’s surface. An unprotected person takes 1d6 radiation damage per hour, and a starship without shielding takes 1d6 crew casualties per day or part thereof.\r\n\r\nMagnetars additionally disturb sensor or scanner readings, inflicting a -2d6 penalty to them, as well as to any space navigation checks.",

This is a broad category of unusual space-time phenomena; the actual laws of physics can be different within a spatial anomaly, and each is unique.\r\n\r\nGaseous. A gaseous anomaly refers to any kind of unusual gas cloud. They are often analyzed by scientific ships which dispatch sensitive probes to measure and catalog them.\r\n\r\nTemporal. Temporal anomalies are very dangerous indeed. Time itself can work differently in a temporal anomaly – it might stop, it might move at a different rate, it might flow backwards, or it might fluctuate.\r\n\r\nEnergy.

          "Markdown": "# Summoning Enhancements\r\n\r\nSummon [creature]\r\n\r\nSummoning spells can bring creatures to you from elsewhere (such as the classic demon summoning), create a creature out of existing material (like turning bones into a skeletal warrior), or can create a creature whole cloth (like making a construct out of ectoplasm). How the creature ends up in front of you doesn’t matter except for flavor reasons. The more MP you spend, the more powerful a creature you can create, build, or summon. High-MP Summon spells can also create multiple weaker creatures.\r\n\r\nYou cannot use a Summon spell to bring a specific individual to you, unless the creature is extraplanar. Thus, you could summon Bharat, Warrior of the Heaven of Snows, but you cannot summon Hrothgar the baker from your home town (unless you’re in another dimension). If a creature is semi-sentient, you cannot choose to summon it specifically; you simply get a random creature of the appropriate type.\r\n\r\nYou have no special control over the summoned creature. Other skills allow you to bind, anchor, or compel creatures. However, you do have enough of a connection to the summoned creature that it can understand you to the extent of its intelligence (a LOG 2 animal can understand simple commands, and a LOG 3 creature can understand more complex commands).\r\n\r\nWhen the spell ends, extraplanar summoned creatures return whence they came, taking with them any items or injuries they received. The same creature cannot be summoned again the same day. Creatures you simply created or cobbled together from local material vanish or revert to their original form, and if you try to summon them again, you will simply create a new creature very similar to the last.\r\n\r\nA summon cantrip can summon a tiny, harmless creature such as a mouse or rat, for up to one round; the creature summoned has no special intelligence or abilities.\r\n\r\nSummoning. Cost 1 MP per die. The primary enhancement for summoning spells is to buy the power level of creatures you can summon. Note that this does not compel or bind the creature—it is free to act as it wishes upon arrival unless other enhancements are used! Summoning requires an attack roll against the creature’s highest Defense. The cost is 1 MP for each die in the creature’s maximum dice pool.",

Sylvan Elves can be xenophobic at times, and are well-trained in the arts of both war and nature.\r\n\r\nSylvan Elves are slim, like their Grand Elf cousins, but much shorter, at about 5 feet in height. With pointed ears, their skin tones tend to be dark or earthy, their hair brown, black, or sometimes with a greenish tinge. Unlike the Grand Elves, Sylvan Elves are not immortal. However, they have extremely long life spans of up to two-thousand years.\r\n\r\nNaturally magical, Sylvan Elves know the words and spells of the forest. They are known to talk to plants and command animals. At home in the trees, Sylvan Elves are also adept at hiding their presence, and more than a few unwary intruders have found themselves ambushed upon entering Sylvan woodlands.\r\n\r\n## Statistics\r\n\r\nSize/Type: Medium; fey\r\n\r\nAttributes: AGI +2, END +2, MAG +2\r\n\r\nSkill Choices: [magical], animal handling, bows, climbing, herbalism, nature, running, stealth, survival, tracking\r\n\r\n## Exploits\r\n\r\n- Agile. Sylvan Elves are noted for dexterity. When taking a new career, a Sylvan Elf may exchange one of the listed attribute increases for AGI, as long as this doesn’t result in duplicate advancement.\r\n- Fey. Elves of all types are considered Fey.\r\n- Healthy. Sylvan Elves are completely immune to illness and disease of a non-magical nature.\r\n- Nature Affinity. All Sylvan Elves can communicate with animals, although this does not grant the animal intelligence it would not otherwise have.\r\n- Sylvan Elf Longevity. When creating a Sylvan Elf character, multiply your career lengths by 4.\r\n- Trance. Sylvan Elves do not need to sleep. They may choose to meditate, instead, while their non-elven companions are sleeping, but this is not necessary.\r\n- Tree-Dwellers. Sylvan Elves gain a CLIMB speed equal to their regular SPEED.\r\n- Unimpeded. Sylvan Elves are not affected or slowed by difficult terrain.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/y1oFf8DaJvCYY4qpnLbLHSJyIDngMDbkrf97zSGeeQeyWmZLOHALLkw8jm6p4ce0cSg4L2XV9OQLBjXG4fwMF-tWRXViXOL781IO9oZAGlmNbie3=w1280)",

          "Markdown": "# Transformation Enhancements\r\n\r\nTransform [element], [creature], or [self]\r\n\r\nTransform spells can turn your target into a particular type of creature or substance. When the spell ends, the target reverts to its original form, though damage taken while transformed endures. You must use the secret of the new form.\r\n\r\nItems and creatures transformed into larger objects or creatures must fit within the area of effect in their new form. You cannot use a transform spell as a directly offensive spell that is unavoidable: you cannot turn the air over a creature into a metal block to crush it, nor can you turn the air around it into stone.\r\n\r\nWhen transformed into a creature, the target gains the new form’s physical attributes, but not its mental attributes. Creatures keep their original mind, personality, and memories. If you transform a creature into another creature, its gear adapts to an appropriate form if there is one. Other items are subsumed into the new form, such as weapons if the form has no hands with which to wield them.\r\n\r\nFor objects, the total MP you spend determines the maximum gold coin value of items you can produce at a rate of 300 gc per MP.\r\n\r\nA transform cantrip can change the color of an object or target, or make other minor cosmetic changes, for up to one round.\r\n\r\nThe “secret” part of a transformation spell is the resultant form, not the starting form. Transforming a floor from stone to ice is transform ice, not transform stone.\r\n\r\nAnimate. Cost 2 MP per die. Transform an object into a creature. The object gains a mind and intelligence appropriate to its new form, although the highest LOG, WIL, or CHA attribute it can gain is 3. The cost is 2 MP for each die in the creature’s maximum dice pool.\r\n\r\nBulk Transform. Cost varies. Rather than simply changing a surface (as in Difficult Terrain), this transforms bulk material in 5' cubes. The effect must fit within the spell’s area, but in addition the spell costs 3 MP per 5' cube. This also applies to large structures such as castle walls, or to digging out ground (by transforming stone to air or something similar) for the duration of the spell.\r\n\r\nDe-Animate. Cost 8 MP. Transform a creature into an object. To transform an unwilling subject, you must spend an additional 6 MP. This includes the ability to turn creatures to stone (petrification).\r\n\r\nDifficult Terrain. Cost 0 MP. Most terrain transformations are able to create difficult terrain. Difficult terrain halves a creature’s Speed unless it has an ability which allows it to move normally in such terrain. Difficult terrain can be caused by snow (ice), mud (ooze or earth), rubble (earth), swamp (water), deep undergrowth (plant), and more.\r\n\r\nElemental Damage. Cost 0 or 1 MP. Damage caused by transformed terrain can do up to 1 point of damage for free. By spending 1 MP, the damage can be increased to 1d6 damage of the appropriate type. This damage is automatic, and requires no attack roll. For more damage, evocation spells must be used instead. Elements useful for damaging effects include lava, acid, plants (thorns), earth (jagged ground), and so on.\r\n\r\nEnlarge/Shrink. Cost 4 MP per size category. You can enlarge or shrink an object or creature.\r\n\r\nImmobilize. Cost 5 MP. An immobilized creature suffers the severe Mobility status when it enters or starts its turn in the area. It can shake this off as normal. An immobilized creature cannot move from its spot on its own power (including flight) but is not paralyzed and can take actions normally. A creature might be immobilized by sticky mud (earth), ooze, grasping plants or even freezing ice.\r\n\r\nSlick. Cost 2 MP. Slick areas are more slippery even than slippery areas. While a slippery area is merely difficult terrain (half Speed), a slick area is also almost impossible to stand on. Creatures can move safely across slick terrain at a Speed of 1. If they move faster than this, they must make a Difficult [16] AGI check or fall prone, ending their movement for that action. Note that slick areas are difficult terrain, too.\r\n\r\nSplit. Cost varies. You can split the target into multiple entities (1 MP for each). If transforming a target into multiple creatures, the total cost is that used for the Transform Creature enhancement. They all recombine when the spell ends as long as at least one is left.\r\n\r\nTransform Creature. Cost 2 MP per die. Transform a creature into another creature. The target is transformed into a creature of the specified type. To transform an unwilling subject, you must spend an additional 6 MP. The cost is 2 MP for each die in the new creature’s maximum dice pool (minimum 2 MP).\r\n\r\nTransform Element. Cost 1 MP per 300 gc value or by size. Transform an object into another object of similar size. For example, this can transform scraps of wood into a wagon wheel. This also enables the object’s new form to be of a different material. Use the value or the size of the object, whichever is larger.\r\n\r\nWater Breathing. Cost 1 MP. The target is able to breathe normally underwater. For 2 MP, the target doesn’t need to breathe at all for the spell’s duration.\r\n\r\nNote that the maximum depth/height of a transform effect that alters terrain is 5'. Deeper or taller effects can be achieved by layering effects one atop (or underneath) the other until the desired depth/height is achieved.",

Living nightmares communicate via telepathy; this ability is independent of language and can be used to converse with any creature it can see.\r\nAssume Nightmare. A living nightmare embodies one of the below emotions.  In addition to any specific effects of that transformation, assuming a nightmare transforms the living nightmare into a new form related to that emotion.\r\nAnger. Mocking Gaze. The target is rendered enraged on a successful  mental attack.\r\nDread. Dread Visage. Any who can see the living nightmare immediately becomes nervous. Each round they begin within 30 feet of the living nightmare they must also make a Difficult [16] WIL check or become Afraid.\r\nGreed. Covetous Glance. As a single action, a living nightmare can look longingly at two targets, making a mental attack against the target with the lowest MENTAL DEFENSE. If successful, the does not treat the second target as an ally for one minute, and cannot benefit from or provide bonuses such as flanking from them.\r\nShame. Secret Shame. As a free action, a living nightmare can cause a target within 30 feet to focus momentarily on their deepest shame. The living nightmare makes a mental attack, and if successful the target is rendered Dazed.\r\nAssume Shape. A living nightmare can assume any form it chooses, though this form always remains medium-sized, even if the creature or object it appears as would be larger or smaller. No matter what form it assumes, the change is entirely cosmetic and has no effect on the living nightmare’s statistics. For instance, if the living nightmare were to assume the form of a dragon, it would not gain any extra attacks or a breath weapon, and it would appear as a medium-sized dragon.\r\nDeep Slumber. A living nightmare renders one target severely Sleeping, or all targets within 30' Sleeping, with a mental attack. The sleep is fitful and full of nightmares.

They tend towards the ascetic, and, indeed, have a society which highly favors the monastic orders to which so many belong.\r\n\r\nThe Vendalyrian style of self-discipline and avoidance of indulgence gives the species a somewhat aloof demeanor which can be off-putting. Vendalyrians are naturally psionic.\r\n\r\nMany of the Vendalyrian monastic orders, of which there are thousands, focus on the martial arts and self-discipline. For this reason, Vendalyrians—while being pacifistic in nature— are often very skilled combatants.\r\n\r\nVendalyrian adventurers tend to be priests, healers, and scientists.\r\n\r\nVendalyrians stand roughly five and a half to six feet tall and weigh an average of 160 pounds. Though generally slender, most Vendalyrians are well-muscled due to an active lifestyle of regimented exercise and martial training. Skin tones among the Vendalyrians tend toward a very narrow range of tan. Their slim, hairless build plus the pointed ears and the epicanthal fold of the upper eyelids give the Vendalyrians a vaguely elfin look.\r\n\r\n## Statistics\r\n\r\nSize/type: Medium; humanoid\r\n\r\nAttributes: AGI +1, LOG +2, LUC -2, PSI +3\r\n\r\nSkill choices: reactions, acrobatics, perception, concentration, religion, [scientific]\r\n\r\n## Exploits\r\n\r\n- Naturally Psionic. A society which integrates psionics from childhood, Vendalyrians start play with one free psionic exploit.\r\n- Acute Hearing. Vendalyrians have excellent hearing, and gain a +1d6 bonus to perception checks when sound is relevant.\r\n- Learned. Vendalyrians start with four species skills rather than three. The bonus (fourth) skill must be a [scientific] skill.\r\n- Disciplined. The mental discipline of a Vendalyrian is such that they are completely immune to the Fatigued condition as long as they get 8 hours sleep per week. This is not a preferred situation, however.\r\n- Long-lived. When creating a Vendalyrian character, multiply their career lengths by 5.\r\n- Logical. Vendalyrians are noted for their intelligence and logic. When taking a new career, a Vendalyrian may optionally exchange one of the listed four attribute increases for LOG, as long as it doesn’t result in a duplicate attribute advancement.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/IvHLe5f5gnZgkizDk3c15uLg2H_t2gfJWLmDlqVWTnDICjLvui9z_FfSwHIjDxw9br1kuSoCML9zHTM3eRXy2qnSpH2QnPNWD1eYB9B761QjXbXZ=w1280)",
